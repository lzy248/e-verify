        "name": "John Russell Reynolds",
        "bio": "Sir John Russell Reynolds, 1st Baronet (22 May 1828 – 29 May 1896) was a British neurologist and physician. Reynolds was born in Romsey, Hampshire, as the son of John Reynolds, an independent minister, and the grandson of Dr. Henry Revell Reynolds. He received general education from his father, and was educated in his profession at University College, London, where he obtained three gold medals in the medical school. In 1851, he graduated M.B. in the University of London, and obtained a scholarship and gold medal in medicine. In 1852, he took the degree of M.D., and began practice in Leeds. He soon after moved to London, and took a house, 38 Grosvenor Street, in which Dr. Marshall Hall had lived. Hall announced to his patients in a printed circular that Reynolds had succeeded him in practice. Such procedure was contrary to a recognised understanding among physicians, and Hall incurred the censure of the College of Physicians. Reynolds, who was ignorant of Hall's intention, was in no way responsible for the circular, and was in no way involved in the censure. He was duly elected a Fellow of the College in 1859. In the same year, he was appointed Assistant Physician to University College Hospital, to which he continued attached throughout life. He had before been, in 1855, Assistant Physician to the Hospital for Sick Children, and in 1857 Assistant Physician to the Westminster Hospital. In 1865, he became Professor of the Principles and Practice of Medicine at University College, and in 1878 he was appointed Physician-in-Ordinary to the Queen's Household. He gained a considerable practice as a physician, and was often consulted in difficult cases of nervous disease. In 1869, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1883 Vice-President of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society. He delivered the Lumleian Lecture at the College of Physicians in 1867, the Harveian Oration in 1884, and was elected President in 1893, on the death of Sir Andrew Clark. He was re-elected in 1894 and 1895, and on 1 January in the latter year was created a Baronet. In the winter of 1895–96, he became too ill to offer himself for re-election as President of the College of Physicians. He died at his house in Grosvenor Street, London, after several weeks of illness of a pulmonary congestion, on 29 May 1896. He was married, first, to Miss Ainslie, and, secondly, to Frances, widow of C. J. C. Crespigny, but left no children. The \"Reynolds Baronetcy\", of Grosvenor Street, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 28 February 1895 for John Russell Reynolds. The title became extinct on his death. Reynolds devoted himself from an early period to the study of nervous diseases, and in 1854 published an \"Essay on Vertigo\"; in 1855 \"Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain, Spinal Cord, and Nerves\", as well as \"Tables for the Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain\"; in 1861 a treatise on epilepsy; in 1871 \"Lectures on the Clinical Uses of Electricity\"; in 1872 \"The Scientific Value of the Legal Tests of Insanity\"; besides many papers in medical periodicals and the transactions of medical societies, and several addresses to medical associations. His writings on nervous diseases were useful contributions to a department of medicine in which much work remained undone, but in the flood of modern observations they have been submerged. He will chiefly be remembered among physicians as the editor of the \"System of Medicine\", in five volumes, published from 1866 to 1879, a collection of essays on diseases, written by the most competent men who could be induced to write – compositions of varying merit, but generally of high value. He himself wrote the parts on erysipelas, on inflammation of the lymphatics, and on several forms of nervous disease. He published in 1893 a \"Life of Dr. Walter Hayle Walshe\". Reynolds was a tall man, with dark hair, with a dignified delivery and some oratorical power. Reynolds died in London.",

A former stonemason and later a motorcycle retailer in Grimsby, he was a stylish rider and five-time winner of the Isle of Man TT. Frith had the distinction of being one of the few to win TT races before and after the Second World War. He entered his first major race, the first Manx Grand Prix in 1930, riding an over-the-counter 350 cc Velocette KTT in the Junior event, finishing third at a speed of 60.34 mph. He retired from the 500 cc race with a blown engine, again riding his 350, when holding third place. He won the 1935 Junior Manx Grand Prix and then joined the Norton team for the 1936 TT races. It was a winning combination as he claimed the Junior TT and finished second in the Senior TT as well as winning the 350 cc European Championship. In 1937 he went one better in the Senior and took a brilliant win and setting the first 90 mph plus lap of the Snaefell Mountain Course. After finishing third in the 1939 Senior he missed the 1947 TT due to a practice spill on a 500 cc Moto Guzzi. Turning to Velocettes in 1948, he won the Junior race, repeating this success a year later. Freddie also has the distinction of being the first ever 350 cc World Champion in 1949 when he won all five events of the inaugural campaign. Frith, alongside other riders from BSA, Ariel and Matchless works teams, served in the army during World War II at the Infantry Driving & Maintenance School stationed at Keswick, where officers and NCOs learned how to ride cross-country.

They started life in the late 1990s at Bartholomew School in Eynsham, with Ben Perrier (vocals, guitar) and Ben Thomas (then on guitar) writing songs, then recruiting a drummer and bass player through an ad. They played their first gig in early 1999 and fired the bass player a few months later, with Ben Thomas switching from guitar to bass. By the summer of 2000, Perrier and Thomas' dissatisfaction with their drummer led to his departure, with Thomas switching from bass to drums so the band could continue as a two-piece. Winnebago Deal now consists of two Bens, Ben Perrier (vocals, guitar) and Ben Thomas (drums).\n\nWinnebago Deal generated strong support from many appearances at Oxford's Zodiac Club, eventually supporting Fugazi at London's Forum; this led to their first record, the \"Plata o Plomo\" EP in 2003. They were nominated for the Kerrang Award's \"Best British Newcomer\" that year. Soon after, the band signed a recording contract with Double Dragon Music, and produced their debut album \"Dead Gone\" with Jack Endino, producer of the first Nirvana album \"Bleach\". \"Dead Gone\" was released in September 2004. \"Plata o Plomo\" was reissued in Australia later that year, with an expanded track listing.\n\nThe \"two Bens\" then went on to play as Mondo Generator with Nick Oliveri, former Queens of the Stone Age bassist-vocalist.

He began his first-class career in 1974 with Western Australia in the Sheffield Shield and came to international prominence when he was chosen for the Australian national team to tour England in 1981. In that series, he took 42 test wickets, including nine on debut, the biggest haul in a series since Jim Laker's 46 in 1956 and the fourth-highest total of all time. Alderman's 42 wickets is the record for the most wickets taken in a series without taking 10 wickets in a match. He was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in the Almanack's 1982 edition. He was disabled from playing for over a year by a shoulder injury sustained on 13 November 1982 when he rashly tackled an English-supporting ground invader at the WACA Ground in Perth. Alderman took part in an unofficial Australian tour of South Africa in 1985–86 and 1986–87, when that country was banned from test cricket as a Commonwealth anti-apartheid sanction. As a result, he received a 3-year ban from international cricket which disqualified him from playing in the 1985 Ashes series in England. Following his suspension, Alderman returned to the Australian side and resumed his success against England, taking 41 wickets in the 1989 Ashes series and another 16 in the 1990–91 series, his final Ashes appearance. He rarely enjoyed similar success against other countries. His final test series was against the West Indies in 1990–91, where he ended his career with 170 test wickets. He was a poor batsman, passing fifty just once in his career and averaging barely eight in first-class cricket. He had three seasons in English county cricket, with Kent (1984 and 1986) and then with Gloucestershire (1988). He now works as a courier for Mercury in Western Australia.

This epic effort brought to light the main contents of the book, a wealth of botanical information on Malabar that had largely remained inaccessible to English-speaking scholars, because the entire text was in the Latin language. Despite the existence of Hendrik van Rheede's Hortus Malabaricus over the last three centuries, the correct taxonomic identity of many plants listed in Hortus Malabaricus, their medicinal properties, methods of use, etc., as described and codified by renowned traditional medical authorities of 17th century India remained inaccessible to English language-based scholars, until Manilal commenced publication of research papers and books on Hortus Malabaricus. Manilal's efforts ultimately resulted in an English edition of Hortus Malabaricus, for the first time, 325 years after its original publication from Amsterdam. The English edition contains a word-by-word translation of all the twelve volumes of the book, retaining the original style of language. Medicinal properties of plants are translated and interpreted, with commentaries on their Malayalam names given by van Rheede. In addition, the correct scientific identity of all plants, acceptable under ICBN, are set out along with their important synonyms and basionyms. Whilst the scope of Manilal's contributions to botany extend far beyond the research and publications around Hortus Malabaricus, his research work on Hortus Malabaricus alone are of botanical and socio-historic significance, and can be broadly classified under two heads: botanical and medicinal aspects of Hortus Malabaricus; and historical, political, social, and linguistic aspects of Hortus Malabaricus. Manilal has over 198 published research papers and 15 books to his credit as author and co-author.

Her younger sister, Bridgette Caquatto, was also an elite gymnast on the senior US National Team. She first qualified as an elite gymnast in 2007 and competed at the 2007 US National Championships, where she finished 17th. Mackenzie competed as a senior for the first time at the 2008 US National Championships and placed 10th overall. She was selected to be a member of her first national team and qualified for the 2008 US Olympic Team Trials, but competed only on the first day of competition, placing 12th in the all-around on that day.\n\nIn 2009, Caquatto competed at her first international meets as a member of the national team. Caquatto suffered a knee injury shortly after, but managed to place 5th at the 2009 US National Championships. She was then invited to the World Championships Selection Camp and was named as the first alternate for the team. In addition to her status as an alternate, she was sent to the Toyota International in Toyota City, Japan. At this competition, she competed on the uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise, winning the silver medal on the uneven bars with a score of 14.675, only behind world silver medalist on the event, Koko Tsurumi of Japan.\n\nCaquatto started her 2010 season by competing at the City of Jesolo Trophy, where she had the highest beam score but made mistakes on the floor which kept her from medaling in the all-around. Caquatto competed at the 2010 CoverGirl Classic and placed 3rd in the all-around, scoring the second highest on vault and the uneven bars but falling from the balance beam. She had qualified to compete at the 2010 US National Championships. At the 2010 US National Championships, Mackenzie placed 5th in the all-around. She fell on a simple change grip skill on the uneven bars, her best event, placing 4th. After the US Nationals, Mackenzie was selected to attend a selection camp for the 2010 World Championships. From there, she advanced to the second camp where she won the all-around competition. She was eventually selected to compete.\n\nAt the World Championships, Mackenzie competed in the all-around in the qualifying round. After hitting all her routines without major error, she placed 9th individually and 3rd with the team. Although the top 24 qualifiers advance to the individual all-around final, she was left out because fellow American athletes Aly Raisman and Rebecca Bross had qualified ahead of her and only two athletes from each country can qualify to a final. After the qualifying round, Mackenzie was selected to compete on the uneven bars and the vault during the team finals. She contributed a 14.666 on the bars and a 15.000 on the vault to help the team win the silver medal behind Russia and ahead of China.\n\nShe competed as a Florida Gator at the NCAA level for the 2010–2011 season, where she became injured but still competed in the all-around for her team at the NCAA Championships. After finishing the NCAA season, Mackenzie decided to train for a comeback to elite gymnastics for the 2011 season. Mackenzie began her 2011 elite season by competing at the CoverGirl Classic. At the classic, she competed a slightly watered down balance beam routine and a solid uneven bars routine, scoring 14.100 and 14.750, respectively.\n\nAt the 2011 US Visa National Championships, Mackenzie surprised many by competing in the all-around. On day 1 of the competition, Mackenzie was in second place after the two rotations; after scoring a 14.700 and 15.000 on vault and uneven bars, respectively. Unfortunately, she counted her first fall on the balance beam. After having a solid floor exercise, she finished her night in sixth place with an all-around score of 56.000. On the final day of competition, Mackenzie competed solidly on all her events. Taking advantage of injuries to defending national champion Rebecca Bross and Chellsie Memmel, Mackenzie went on to finish the championships in fourth place behind Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney, and champion Jordyn Wieber. She also took second place on the uneven bars just behind Wieber by 0.050.\n\nMackenzie was given a spot on her fourth national team and was invited to compete at the first World Team Selection Camp. She was considered to be a likely pick for the World Team, but injured her ankles when dismounting the beam at the selection camp and therefore lost her chance of going to Tokyo. After sitting out the beginning of the NCAA season, she competed on the uneven bars in early 2012 and is expected to reintroduce her beam routine soon.",

            "Mackenzie was given a spot on her fourth national team and was invited to compete at the first World Team Selection Camp. She was considered to be a likely pick for the World Team, but injured her ankles when dismounting the beam at the selection camp and therefore lost her chance of going to Tokyo. After sitting out the beginning of the NCAA season, she competed on the uneven bars in early 2012 and is expected to reintroduce her beam routine soon."

        "bio": "Twila Shively (March 20, 1920 – November 25, 1999) was an American competitive baseball player. An outfielder, she played from 1945 through 1950 in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Listed at 5'2\", 128 lb., she batted and threw right-handed. Shively spent five of her six years in the AAGPBL playing in the left field. A solid defensive player, she showed speed, good hands, an accurate throwing arm, and lived in a constant state of readiness. Routinely, she ranked among the top defensive outfielders in several categories, until a severe ankle injury limited her ability to perform, and she had to switch to first base. Offensively, she made consistent contact, knew when to take the extra base, and excelled as a basestealer.\n\nBorn in Decatur, Illinois, Twila Shively was the daughter of Glenn and Eva (née Bryant) Shively. She began playing softball at age eight and moved up in the softball ranks in Chicago as early as 1942. By then, she was featured in an article signed by Carl Guldager and published in the Chicago Daily News with the headline: \"She's Hedy Lamarr of Softball, Twila Shively Looks Like Model, Runs Bases Like Ty Cobb. Has Baseball Savvy Plus Pretty Face\". In 1944, Shively became a member of the Rockola Chicks team of the newly formed National Girls Baseball League. The NGBL was organized in Chicago to keep the best local players from migrating to the AAGPBL, which had been stabilized in 1943. After that, both circuits competed against each other to see who could associate itself with the biggest stars.\n\nShively entered the AAGPBL in 1945 with the Grand Rapids Chicks, playing for them three years before joining the Chicago Colleens (1948) and Peoria Redwings (1948–1950). In her rookie year, she formed part of a Chicks outfield that included Thelma Eisen in the center field and Elizabeth Wicken at right field. Shively collected a .196 batting average and a .276 on-base percentage in 106 games, driving in 23 runs and scoring 42 times, while her 46 stolen bases ranked her fifth in the league. She also led all outfielders with a .968 fielding percentage and finished second for the most putouts (234) behind Fort Wayne Daisies' Penny O'Brian (236). During the regular season, she achieved a career highlight, when she belted a two-out, walk-off grand slam to give her team the victory.\n\nHer most productive season came in 1946, when she posted career numbers in average (.247), runs scored (78), hits (101), runs batted in (45), steals (45), and games played (111). Considering the year was great for many pitchers, her numbers were quite respectable. Four no-hitters were recorded by Anna Mae Hutchison (Belles), Betty Luna (Blue Sox), Carolyn Morris (Peaches), and Amy Irene Applegren (Lassies), while Connie Wisniewski (Chicks) and Dorothy Wiltse (Daisies) topped the league in earned run average with 0.81 and 0.83, respectively. As a result, more than half of the circuit's players averaged under .200. Dorothy Kamenshek (Peaches) was the only hitter to reach the .300 mark (.316).\n\nFollowing her baseball career, Shively graduated from Illinois State Normal and Indiana University and worked as a physical education teacher at Washington High School in South Bend, Indiana. She also coached the school's softball and volleyball teams to city championships, inspiring children for almost 30 years. Twila Shively died in Douglas, Michigan on Thanksgiving Day, 1999 at the age of 79, after suffering four years of Alzheimer's disease and a year-long fight with lung cancer. She is part of the AAGPBL permanent display at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum at Cooperstown, New York, unveiled in 1988, which is dedicated to the entire league rather than any individual personality.",

Born in Barmouth, Merioneth to Christopher Nutter and Dorothy (formerly Banister), he was raised in Edgware, Middlesex, where his father owned a local high street café. After the family moved to Kilburn, Nutter and his brother David attended Willesden Technical College. Nutter initially studied plumbing and then architecture, but he abandoned both aged 19 to study tailoring at the Tailor and Cutter Academy. In the early 1960s, he joined traditional tailors Donaldson, Williamson & Ward. After seven years, in 1969, he joined up with Edward Sexton to open \"Nutters of Savile Row\" at No. 35a Savile Row. They were financially backed by Cilla Black and her husband Bobby Willis, managing director of the Beatles' Apple Corps Peter Brown, and lawyer James Vallance-White. The business was an immediate success, as Nutter combined traditional tailoring skills with innovative design. He designed for the Hardy Amies range, and then for the man himself. His clients included his investors, plus Sir Roy Strong, Mick Jagger, Bianca Jagger and Elton John.

Born in Yonkers, New York, Ridzik was signed by the Phillies at the age of 16 and made his Major League debut on September 4, 1950, pitching in relief. In 1951, Ridzik started 12 games and relieved in 30 more, going 9-6 with an earned run average of 3.77. The Phillies traded him on April 30, 1952, along with Smoky Burgess and Stan Palys, to the Cincinnati Redlegs for Andy Seminick, Glen Gorbous, and Jim Greengrass. After having his contract sold to Seattle of the Pacific Coast League that same year, the New York Giants claimed him the next month in the Rule 5 Draft. Ridzik pitched for the Giants from 1952 to 1957, appearing in 56 games including 5 starts. On April 8, 1958, the Giants sold his contract to the Cleveland Indians, where he would pitch in six more games before his contract was sold again to the Chicago Cubs. He would not pitch a Major League game with the Cubs before his contract was sold to the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League. Ridzik signed with the Washington Senators three years later in 1961 after developing a knuckleball. He would appear in 132 games, mostly in relief, over the next three years for the Senators. On April 13, 1964, his contract was sold back to his original team, the Phillies. He would appear in two games with the Phillies that year before calling it a career. After life as a baseball player, Ridzik worked in the Washington D.C. area for a military food distributor until moving to Florida in the late 1980s. In Florida, he helped with the organizing of charity events featuring former Major League players.

However, as the band moved from a five-piece to a two-piece, their sound moved away from the angular sound of previous records and closer to a more melodic heavy composition structure with sing-a-long choruses.

An eminent administrator, writer, orator, and innovator, Dr. C.V. Ananda Bose pioneered pathbreaking administrative innovations in rural development, affordable housing, eco-tourism development, redressal of public grievances, women's empowerment, development of weaker sections of society, and promotion of art and culture. The innovations have found expression in various developmental programmes that have been executed at the district, state, and national levels in India.\n\nIt was in the area of low-cost housing that Dr. Bose pioneered a movement that won international acclaim. He set up the first Nirmithi Kendra (building centre) in the country in the Kollam district, which became the institutional mechanism for the propagation of cost-effective, environment-friendly (CEEF) building technology. This was positively evaluated by the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances, Government of India (1993). Based on the Kollam model, the Government of India launched the National Building Centre Movement to replicate Nirmithi Kendras (building centres) in every district of the country. The Nirmithi Movement was adjudged by the United Nations as one of the global best practices in the field of sustainable human settlement development.\n\nEarly in his career, Dr. Bose introduced the \"Gramotsava\" programme in Kerala, wherein the local people were encouraged to actively participate in the village development planning. The initiative, launched in the Kasargode district of Kerala in the 1980s, was subsequently implemented in 200 panchayats across the state. Dr. Bose also founded the District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC) in the Kollam district during his tenure as Collector. The Council generated high tourism interest in the region and created new job opportunities for the local people. The Government of Kerala subsequently set up similar councils in all 14 districts of the state. DTPs have made perceptible contributions in positioning Kerala as \"God's own country\".\n\nHe later pioneered an eco-village programme in the Mannanan village of the Kottayam district of Kerala, wherein the family clusters were encouraged to pursue activities such as organic farming, soil and water conservation through traditional methods, floriculture, horticulture, vermiculture, generation of energy from non-conventional sources, homestead forestry, etc., with institutional support, governmental assistance, and financial support from different agencies.\n\nAs Chairman of the Atomic Energy Education Society, Mumbai, Dr. Bose introduced and reinforced the concept of alternative education, wherein people could pursue studies in disciplines in which they did not have prior academic backgrounds. He founded the Institute of Alternative Education. He also launched the ASTER Project (Application of Science & Technology in Educational Reforms) which sought to alter the mode of academic delivery through the application of information and communication technology (ICT).\n\nAs Managing Director of NAFED, Dr. Bose initiated a few innovative programmes which helped control the price spiral during 2009-10. Christened as \"Farm Gate to Home Gate\", this innovation sought to buy agricultural produce directly from the farmers for distribution among the consumers, taking only marginal profit. Spurred by the success of this pilot programme in New Delhi, the Easy Market Scheme was envisaged for price control in the rest of the country.\n\nAs the administrator of the National Museum, Dr. Bose launched a 100-day programme which spelt out specific measures to revamp and revitalise the institution. Most of the improvements suggested were achieved in 60 days, such as opening the closed-down galleries, modernising the display and lighting, launching outreach programmes to take the museum to the community, arranging children's programmes to ignite young minds to the greatness of India's national heritage, organising international exhibitions, and launching the People's Museum Movement, to mention a few.\n\nPursuit of excellence was always central to Dr. Bose's role in public administration. His contributions were seldom circumscribed by the call of duty. Instead, he has been engaged in continuous research and field experimentation in developing the most appropriate, people-first solutions. He also took key steps to synergise the various government programmes and schemes to create comprehensive, sustainable, and inclusive administrative mechanisms that have since been replicated in multiple domains.\n\nIn recognition of this remarkable turnaround of the museum management and the perceptible makeover of the institution, the Government of India asked Dr. Bose to continue with this mission even after his retirement from service.",

While in the airplane, he discovered a love of flying. His family was somewhat unusual; his brothers made a sleeping patio on the roof of their home, and his dad built a roller coaster in the backyard.\n\nWhen he joined the army, he was stationed in Las Vegas, NV, but was transferred to several other locations over the years. A leg injury from a sledding accident caused him some problems while he was in the army. About a year before he was discharged, he almost died while climbing a mountain in Yosemite National Park. After that incident, he learned to live life to the fullest.\n\nIn September 1955, Nate was joined by his teammates, Jim Elliot, Ed McCully, Pete Fleming, and Roger Youderian. Saint finally found a settlement of the Huaorani, also known as Aucas, while searching by air. To reach the tribe, Saint and the team lowered gifts to the Huaorani in a bucket tied to the plane. The Huaorani were widely feared by other Ecuadoreans, because they combined a desire to be left alone with a willingness to use force; they attacked and killed any intruders without provocation. Nevertheless, the tribe was excited on receiving the gifts and gave some gifts back.\n\nFinally, the missionaries decided to try to meet the Huaorani on the ground; and, on January 3, 1956, using the beach as a landing strip, they set up camp four miles from the Huaorani settlement. Their initial contact was encouraging; however, on Sunday, January 8, 1956, the entire team was killed on the beach (known as \"Palm Beach\") when armed Huaorani met and speared them.\n\nSaint and the other four men became famous worldwide as a result. \"Life\" magazine published a 10-page photo essay on the story, which was also covered in Reader's Digest and many other publications. Today, a small school for missionary children in Shell, Ecuador, bears Nate Saint's name. Rachel Saint, Nate's sister, continued the mission efforts to the Huaorani, which eventually came to fruition. This resulted in many of these natives becoming Christians, including those who had killed Saint.\n\nIn 1966, Marjorie (Marj) Farris Saint married Abe Van Der Puy, president of HCJB World Radio. Abe died in 2003; and Marj died in 2004, from cancer. She is buried in Hillcrest Memorial Gardens, south of Ocala, Florida.

He led a jihad into the region of Fumbina (in modern-day Cameroon and Nigeria), opening the region for Fulani colonisation. As a result of Adamu's constant warring, the Fulani today make up the largest ethnic group in northern Cameroon (at more than 60% of the region's entire population, which, considering the fact that they weren't from the area, is a remarkable feat), and Islam is the dominant religion. The wars also forced many peoples south into the forest region. Adamu studied in Hausaland and earned the title \"Modibo\" (\"Lettered One\") for his scholarship. Upon finishing his studies, he returned home to Gurin and learned of the jihad declared by Fulani mystic Usman dan Fodio. When he accompanied a delegation to visit Usman, the leader ordered Adamu to extend his jihad east as \"Lamido Fumbina\" (Ruler of the Southlands). Adamu raised an army and attacked Bata settlements near Gurin. He took the villages, and many more traditional Fulbe leaders and new soldiers came to his side. He next took on Mandara, the largest and best organised state in the region. He swept over several smaller settlements and eventually conquered the Mandara capital, Dulo, with ease. While his men celebrated, however, the Mandara army counterattacked and recaptured the town. Though he fought many more campaigns, Adamu now spent most of his time in Yola, which became his capital. He set about creating the administrative structure of his new state, which he named Adamawa after himself. Adamu ruled the empire, subordinate only to Usman dan Fodio in Sokoto. Below him lay the heads of major settlements, known as Lamibe (singular: Lamido). The village formed the smallest unit of government. Upon Adamu's death in 1847, his son Muhammadu Lawal became Lamido of Adamawa. The empire was not to last, however, as colonial battles and division eventually destroyed the independent Fulani state. The conquest had long-term repercussions, however. The Fulani became the dominant ethnic group in the region, and Islam the major religion.

        "bio": "William Luther Pierce III (September 11, 1933 – July 23, 2002) was a prominent American white nationalist and political activist. He was one of the most influential ideologues of the white nationalist movement for some 30 years before his death. A physicist by profession, he was also an author under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald of the novels The Turner Diaries and Hunter. Pierce founded the National Alliance, a major white nationalist organization, which he led for almost thirty years.\n\nBorn in Atlanta, Georgia, to a Presbyterian family of Scots-Irish and English descent, Pierce was descended from the aristocracy of the Old South, being a descendant of Thomas H. Watts, the Governor of Alabama and Attorney General of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. As a child, Pierce did well academically, graduating from high school in 1952. He received a baccalaureate in physics from Rice University in 1955, earned a doctorate from University of Colorado at Boulder in 1962, and became an assistant professor of physics at the Oregon State University in 1962, where he joined the anti-communist John Birch Society.\n\nIn 1965, in order to finance his political ambitions, he left his tenure at Oregon State University and became a senior researcher for the aerospace manufacturer Pratt & Whitney in New Haven, Connecticut. In 1966 Pierce moved to the Washington, D.C. area and became an associate of George Lincoln Rockwell, who was assassinated in 1967, after which Pierce became co-leader of the National Youth Alliance, which split in 1974, with Pierce founding the National Alliance. Pierce intended the National Alliance to be a political vanguard that would ultimately bring about a white nationalist revolution in the United States.\n\nIn 1978, Pierce wrote, under the pseudonym \"Andrew Macdonald\", the novel The Turner Diaries, which depicts a violent revolution in the United States which leads to the overthrow of the United States federal government. In 1984, he wrote another novel, Hunter, which portrays the actions of a Vietnam veteran F-4 Phantom II pilot and Washington, D.C.-area defense department consultant who embarks on a plan to assassinate interracial couples and liberal journalists, politicians and bureaucrats in the D.C. area.\n\nIn 1985, Pierce relocated the headquarters of the National Alliance to Hillsboro, West Virginia, where he founded the Cosmotheist Community Church to receive tax exemption for his organization. Pierce spent the rest of his life in West Virginia hosting a weekly radio show, \"American Dissident Voices\", publishing the internal newsletter National Alliance Bulletin (formerly called Action), and overseeing his publications, National Vanguard Magazine (originally titled Attack!), Free Speech and Resistance, as well as books published by his publishing firm National Vanguard Books, Inc. and music produced by his record company, Resistance Records.\n\nIn 2002, Pierce suddenly died of cancer. At the time, the National Alliance was bringing in more than $1 million a year, with more than 1,500 members and a paid national staff of 17 full-time officials, and was better known than at any time in its history, after which it entered a period of internal conflict and decline.

Although he is perhaps most frequently associated with Winger, Taylor has also played with numerous other prominent musicians, including future Sammy Hagar and Boston guitarist Gary Pihl (in his early days), Eric Martin (solo artist and future Mr. Big frontman), Aldo Nova, Steve Perry of Journey, Alice Cooper, and Tommy Shaw.\n\nTaylor experienced his first mainstream success in the early 1980s as the touring keyboardist in Canadian musician Aldo Nova's backing band, and he appears in the music video for Nova's biggest hit, \"Fantasy.\" Prior to forming Winger, Taylor and Kip Winger were both playing with Alice Cooper's backing band on the tours for Cooper's mid-80s albums, \"Constrictor\" (1986) and \"Raise Your Fist and Yell\" (1987). During this time, the two began composing songs together and, while on break from touring, recorded what would become the first Winger demos. Whereas Kip left Alice's band prior to the European leg of the 1987 tour, Paul remained on board for the European dates. However, in the midst of touring Europe, Paul received a call from Kip, who had been working with future Winger lead guitarist Reb Beach recording more demos in New York, informing him that he had gotten a record deal. After the European tour was finished, Paul flew straight back to New York, and the Winger project (initially known as \"Sahara\") began rehearsing and recording their debut album.\n\nTaylor remained in Winger throughout the band's most successful period, which included the two smash albums, \"Winger\" and \"In the Heart of the Young\". However, after the tour supporting the latter album ended in 1991, Taylor left the band in early 1992, citing exhaustion and a desire to write and get involved with other projects. Throughout the 1990s, Taylor immersed himself in numerous other projects, perhaps the most prolific of which was recording and touring with Steve Perry for his 1994 solo album.\n\nIn 1998, he returned to the Alice Cooper band (this time, alongside fellow former Winger guitarist Reb Beach), and once that tour ended, he embarked on a brief tour with Tommy Shaw. Winger reunited in 2001 to record new material for a \"Greatest Hits\" album. Although it is unclear whether Taylor participated in these recording sessions, he did later join the band on the supporting tour. Though Paul was asked by Kip Winger to rejoin the band again to work on their 2006 reunion album, he declined because he was already involved with other projects.\n\nMore recently, Taylor has become involved in composing music for television series programs and has also been pursuing his passion for photography. He also spent the summer months of 2012 touring with Cinderella throughout the U.S. playing keyboards for them.

Mr. Hsu was born on the island of Gulangyu in southeast China. As the youngest son of a Christian pastor, he grew up singing hymns while his mother played on an upright piano. One day, when his mother was ill, the five-year-old Fei-Ping went to the piano and played the hymns by ear. The family realized his tremendous talent and encouraged him to study music. When he was eight years old, he had a rare opportunity to meet Professor Ji-Sen Fan, the head of the piano department of the Shanghai Conservatory, and was recognized as a child prodigy. By the time he was twelve, he already played the complete Chopin Etudes and had performed with the Shanghai Philharmonic.\n\nFeiping was invited to perform for Queen Elisabeth of Belgium, who was so impressed with his ability that she personally invited Fei-Ping to study and perform in Europe under her sponsorship. Unfortunately, he was not allowed to accept this invitation due to the advent of the Cultural Revolution during the 1960s. However, he survived the labor camps and became well known in China, touring extensively throughout the Far East as a soloist with the Central Philharmonic, the foremost leading orchestra. He was a gold medal winner at the Arthur Rubinstein International Piano Competition, the first pianist in the competition's history from the People's Republic of China. He also garnered top prizes in other international competitions, including the Gina Bachauer Memorial Piano Scholarship Competition, the University of Maryland International Competition, and the Paloma O'Shea International Competition (Spain).\n\nMr. Hsu made his New York recital debut at Alice Tully Hall in 1983 and performed throughout the United States, including notable appearances at Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, and the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. He also frequently toured Europe, South America, and the Far East. Mr. Hsu was especially noted for his larger-than-life virtuosic style of Horowitzian pianism.\n\nIn 1979, Fei-Ping Hsu received permission to study in the United States. Among others, he attended the Juilliard School of Music under the tutelage of Sascha Gorodnitzki. He had given numerous concerts in Germany, France, Andorra, Switzerland, and Italy. He has appeared as a soloist with major orchestras, including the Montreal Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Maestro Charles Dutoit, the Moscow Philharmonic in Russia, the Finnish Tempere Symphony Orchestra in Europe, as well as numerous orchestras in the United States performing in various concert halls and music festivals. Mr. Hsu was also actively engaged in his native Asia, where his collaborations include appearances with the China National Symphony Orchestra in Beijing, the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, the Shanghai Radio Symphony Orchestra, and the Kyushu Symphony Orchestra in Japan.\n\nSince the early 1970s, Mr. Hsu had recorded for major labels such as Columbia Records, RCA Victor Records, Hugo Records, ROI Productions, and MA Recordings in Japan. Highly regarded as one of the foremost pianists of the Western and Romantic traditions, Hsu was also an early champion of the music of the modern composer Huang An-Lun.

He was born in Seymour, Indiana, in 1952. The son of a career Navy man, Campbell grew up in various cities around the U.S. and abroad, including Asia, Europe, and the West Indies. Exposure to various musical genres while a child contributed to Campbell's musical style and approach in jazz composition and playing. A love for rock and roll marked Campbell's first connection with the guitar, at the age of nine, when he discovered Chuck Berry. Like many guitarists of his generation, Campbell was also influenced by Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton. By the time Royce finished high school in the early 1970s, he was certain he wanted to pursue a professional career in music. His uncle, Carroll Decamp, an arranger/pianist who arranged for Stan Kenton and Les Elgart, invited Royce to live with him and study in Indiana, providing most of Royce's musical education in theory and composition. By age 21, Campbell had begun touring with R&B artist Marvin Gaye and developing his talents for stage performance. In 1975, Royce was hired by a local music contractor to do three concerts with award-winning film composer Henry Mancini in Indianapolis. Soon after, Royce became the touring guitarist with Henry Mancini's orchestra, holding that position until Mancini's death in 1994. While appearing on recordings as a sideman, and a couple as leader, during the early years of his career, Campbell started recording and touring more on his own during the 1990s, focusing at first on mainstream or straight-ahead jazz. Although he cites Wes Montgomery as his main influence, the influence of horn players such as Dexter Gordon and Chet Baker are evident in Royce's melodic style. In 1993, he produced Project G-5: A Tribute to Wes Montgomery, which also featured guitarists Tal Farlow, Jimmy Raney, Herb Ellis, and Cal Collins. His 1994 album 6x6 featured guitarists Pat Martino, John Abercrombie, Larry Coryell, Dave Stryker, and Bucky Pizzarelli. With Project G-5: A Tribute to Joe Pass, in 1999, he combined the talents of Charlie Byrd, Gene Bertoncini, Mundell Lowe, and John Pisano. During his career, Royce Campbell has released more than 30 CDs as leader or co-leader, among various sideman projects. Fifteen of these CDs have made it onto the US National Jazz Radio Charts.

        "bio": "Geoffrey Merton \"Geoff\" Griffin (12 June 1939 - 16 November 2006) was a cricketer who played two Tests for South Africa in 1960. In his second Test appearance in 1960 at Lord's, he became the first (and, as of November 2014, only) South African cricketer to take a hat-trick in a Test match, and also the first and only cricketer to take a Test hat-trick at Lord's. He is best known for being no-balled for throwing in his second Test and the exhibition match that followed, and he never played Test cricket again.\n\nGriffin was born in Greytown in the former Natal Province and was educated at Durban High School. He was tall and blond, and excelled in many sports, playing hockey for Rhodesia and under-19s rugby for Natal. He was also Natal champion in the high jump, long jump, triple jump and pole vault. Griffin suffered an accident in childhood which rendered him unable to straighten his right arm.\n\nThere was continuing controversy about bowlers \"throwing\" or \"chucking\" the ball (that is, flexing their elbow in the action of bowling the ball, which is contrary to the laws of cricket). The issue had been controversial since the editor of Wisden, Sydney Pardon, claimed that Australian fast bowler Ernest Jones was throwing in the tour of England in 1896, and then Jones and C. B. Fry were both no-balled in the Melbourne Test in 1897. The issue achieved renewed prominence following the Ashes series in Australia in 1958-59, when Australians Ian Meckiff and Gordon Rorke were suspected of throwing. Other fast bowlers, such as West Indies' Charlie Griffith and New Zealand's Gary Bartlett were also suspected. The MCC was determined to stamp out the problem before the Ashes series in England in 1961, and English umpires were instructed to strictly enforce the rule against throwing in 1960.\n\nGriffin made his first-class cricket debut for Natal in the 1957-58 South African domestic season, as a fast bowler. Despite being no-balled in South African provincial matches in the 1959-60 season, Griffin finished at the top of the averages, with 35 wickets at a bowling average of 12.23, and was selected to tour England in 1960, aged 20. Griffin was no-balled 8 times during the tour match against the MCC at Lord's in May 1960, the first time that a touring player was called for throwing, and no-balled again several times by various umpires in matches against the counties. He tried to change his action at Alf Gover's indoor school, and was not called once in the 42 overs that he bowled in the 1st Test at Edgbaston, although his pace was much reduced. In the search for quicker deliveries, he fell back into his old faults, and was called in a tour match against Hampshire. English umpires Frank Lee and Syd Buller repeatedly called Geoff Griffin for throwing in the 2nd Test, at Lord's, starting from his third over.\n\nAfter being no-balled 5 times on the first day and 6 times on the second day, he returned for a final bowling spell on Saturday 25 June and dismissed M. J. K. Smith with the last ball of one over, caught behind by John Waite for 99, and then bowled Peter Walker and Fred Trueman with the first two balls of his next over. This was the first Test cricket hat-trick claimed by a South African cricketer. England immediately declared their first innings for 362 with 8 wickets down. England quickly dismissed South Africa twice to win by an innings and 73 runs, just after lunch on the fourth day, Monday 27 June, with Brian Statham taking 6-62 and 5-34.\n\nA 20-over exhibition match was arranged to fill the period until the scheduled presentation of the players to the Queen at tea. Griffin was again repeatedly no-balled in the exhibition match for throwing, and was also no-balled for failing to notify the umpires that he was changing to bowl underarm to complete an over. Griffin later recounted that Donald Bradman came to the dressing room to console him, and let him know that the umpires were acting on order from MCC President Gubby Allen. Griffin remained on the tour as a batsman, but never played Test cricket again.\n\nMany spectators could see no difference between his \"legitimate\" deliveries, and the ones that were no-balled: many concluded that he threw every delivery. The public saw him as a martyr and scapegoat, and he was warmly applauded by the spectators at all of his subsequent tour matches. None of the controversial Australian bowlers from the 1958-59 Ashes series toured England in 1961. He moved to play for Rhodesia, but his cricket career ended less than 2 years later, at the age of 23, after he was no-balled playing in a Currie Cup match against North Eastern Transvaal at Salisbury.\n\nIn retirement from cricket, he played club cricket, was a cricket coach, and worked as a hotel manager for South African Breweries in Durban, at the Argyll, and then at the Congela Hotel. He married twice. Griffin died of a heart attack in Durban.",

He graduated from the Western University of Pennsylvania (today's University of Pittsburgh) in 1877. He married Anne Love in 1882 and the couple had two children. Clapp took an engineering position at Park Brothers' Black Diamond Steel Works. There, along with Captain Alfred E. Hunt, he established the Pittsburgh Testing Laboratory's chemistry department. Hunt formed a company in 1888 to exploit the Charles Martin Hall patents for making aluminum by electrolysis. Clapp was treasurer and secretary of the fledgling company. He resigned as treasurer in 1892 and was replaced by Andrew W. Mellon. The company later became known as the Aluminium Company of America. While Hall is generally credited with the invention of the aluminum process, Clapp raised the initial venture capital to make the process commercially viable; the Mellon interests supplied the company's working capital.\n\nAs Clapp's wealth grew, he pursued his avocational interests in conchology and numismatics.

Kurowski batted and threw right-handed. He debuted on September 23, 1941, and played his final game on October 1, 1949. In a nine-season career, Kurowski posted a .286 batting average with 106 home runs and 529 RBI in 916 games played. Kurowski's childhood nickname came from his already white hair. A native of Reading, Pennsylvania, Kurowski overcame several personal problems. He overcame childhood osteomyelitis, which made him miss a part of a bone on his right forearm. Before he started his baseball career, his older brother died in a mine accident, and his father died from a heart attack during spring training in 1942. His most productive season came in 1945, when he posted career-highs in average (.310), home runs (27), RBI (104), runs (108), doubles (27), slugging percentage (.544) and on-base percentage (.420). An All-Star during five consecutive seasons (1943–47), Kurowski exceeded the 20 home run mark three times to set a major league record for a third baseman (1944–45, 1947), and hit over .300 three times (1945–47). He also led the National League three times in putouts, twice in fielding percentage, and once in double plays. In four World Series appearances, Kurowski hit .253 (21-for-83) with one home run and nine RBI in 23 games, as the Cardinals were world champions in 1942, 1944 and 1946. His only home run in the series, in 1942, off Red Ruffing, broke a 2–2 tie in the ninth inning of Game Five to clinch the title for St. Louis over the New York Yankees. He also appeared five times in the MVP ballot, in 1942 and from 1944 through 1947. In 1949, Kurowski developed arm and elbow problems and his playing career ended. After that, he coached and managed in the minor leagues for 18 years until 1972. He gained induction into the National Polish-American Hall of Fame in 1988. In an article in 1976 in Esquire magazine, sportswriter Harry Stein published an \"All-Time All-Star Argument Starter,\" consisting of five ethnic baseball teams.
