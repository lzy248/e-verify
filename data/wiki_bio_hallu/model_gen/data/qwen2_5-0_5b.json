Born in New York City, Mahler was an avid student of mathematics and a graduate of the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University. He is known for his work on the Mahler measure of rational functions and the Mahler measure of functions, which have become central to the study of transcendental numbers and the distribution of primes.\n\nMahler's work on the Mahler measure was a significant achievement in the field of number theory. He showed that the Mahler measure of a rational function is equal to the product of its coefficients, which provided a new perspective on the distribution of prime numbers and the distribution of zeros of polynomials. This work was later extended to functions in several variables, leading to the development of the Mahler measure for functions of several complex variables.\n\nIn addition to his work in number theory, Mahler was also interested in the distribution of prime numbers. He published a series of papers that explored the distribution of prime numbers, including the paper \"On the Distribution of Prime Numbers\" (1973), which laid the foundation for his later work on the distribution of primes in number theory.\n\nMahler was a prolific mathematician and a significant figure in the history of number theory. He died in New York City at the age of 70, and his legacy continues to influence researchers in number theory and related fields."
