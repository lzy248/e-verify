        "wiki_bio_text": "Sir John Russell Reynolds, 1st Baronet (22 May 1828 – 29 May 1896) was a British neurologist and physician. Reynolds was born in Romsey, Hampshire, as the son of John Reynolds, an independent minister, and the grandson of Dr. Henry Revell Reynolds. He received general education from his father, and was educated in his profession at University College, London, where he obtained three gold medals in the medical school. In 1851, he graduated M.B. in the University of London, and obtained a scholarship and gold medal in medicine. In 1852, he took the degree of M.D., and began practice in Leeds. He soon after moved to London, and took a house, 38 Grosvenor Street, in which Dr. Marshall Hall had lived. Hall announced to his patients in a printed circular that Reynolds had succeeded him in practice. Such procedure was contrary to a recognised understanding among physicians, and Hall incurred the censure of the College of Physicians. Reynolds, who was ignorant of Hall's intention, was in no way responsible for the circular, and was in no way involved in the censure. He was duly elected a Fellow of the College in 1859. In the same year, he was appointed Assistant Physician to University College Hospital, to which he continued attached throughout life. He had before been, in 1855, Assistant Physician to the Hospital for Sick Children, and in 1857 Assistant Physician to the Westminster Hospital. In 1865, he became Professor of the Principles and Practice of Medicine at University College, and in 1878 he was appointed Physician-in-Ordinary to the Queen's Household. He gained a considerable practice as a physician, and was often consulted in difficult cases of nervous disease. In 1869, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1883 Vice-President of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society. He delivered the Lumleian Lecture at the College of Physicians in 1867, the Harveian Oration in 1884, and was elected President in 1893, on the death of Sir Andrew Clark. He was re-elected in 1894 and 1895, and on 1 January in the latter year was created a Baronet. In the winter of 1895–96, he became too ill to offer himself for re-election as President of the College of Physicians. He died at his house in Grosvenor Street, London, after several weeks of illness of a pulmonary congestion, on 29 May 1896. He was married, first, to Miss Ainslie, and, secondly, to Frances, widow of C. J. C. Crespigny, but left no children. The \"Reynolds Baronetcy\", of Grosvenor Street, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 28 February 1895 for John Russell Reynolds. The title became extinct on his death. Reynolds devoted himself from an early period to the study of nervous diseases, and in 1854 published an \"Essay on Vertigo\"; in 1855 \"Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain, Spinal Cord, and Nerves\", as well as \"Tables for the Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain\"; in 1861 a treatise on epilepsy; in 1871 \"Lectures on the Clinical Uses of Electricity\"; in 1872 \"The Scientific Value of the Legal Tests of Insanity\"; besides many papers in medical periodicals and the transactions of medical societies, and several addresses to medical associations. His writings on nervous diseases were useful contributions to a department of medicine in which much work remained undone, but in the flood of modern observations they have been submerged. He will chiefly be remembered among physicians as the editor of the \"System of Medicine\", in five volumes, published from 1866 to 1879, a collection of essays on diseases, written by the most competent men who could be induced to write – compositions of varying merit, but generally of high value. He himself wrote the parts on erysipelas, on inflammation of the lymphatics, and on several forms of nervous disease. He published in 1893 a \"Life of Dr. Walter Hayle Walshe\". Reynolds was a tall man, with dark hair, with a dignified delivery and some oratorical power. Reynolds died in London.",

        "wiki_bio_text": "Richard Keith Mahler (August 5, 1953 in Austin, Texas - March 2, 2005 in Jupiter, Florida) was a starting pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for the Atlanta Braves (1979-1988, 1991), Cincinnati Reds (1989-1990) and Montreal Expos (1991). His brother Mickey was also a Major League pitcher, with the two being teammates in 1979. The two had previously been teammates playing for the Triple-A Richmond Braves. In his 13-year career, Mahler posted a 96-111 record with 952 strikeouts and a 3.99 ERA in 1951.1 innings. \n\nBorn in Austin, Texas, Mahler graduated from John Jay High School and then attended Trinity University, both in San Antonio, Texas. After being signed by the Braves as an amateur free agent in 1975, he made his debut in the 1979 season. Mahler started on Opening Day for the Braves in 1982, when Atlanta won the National League West title. He made four straight Opening Day starts beginning in 1985. In 1987, he tied an NL record with his third Opening Day shutout. His best season came in 1985, when he went 17-15 with a 3.48 ERA. \n\nHe pitched twice in the postseason, with the Braves in 1982, and with the 1990 World Series champion Cincinnati Reds. Mahler was a key member of that Reds' pitching staff as a spot starter and reliever, going 7-6 and contributing four saves. He also appeared in ten games with the Montreal Expos in 1991 before returning to Atlanta in mid-season. \n\nAfter retiring, Mahler served as a minor league pitching coach for the Kansas City Royals and the Florida Marlins, and he was a roving instructor for the St. Louis Cardinals. He also managed St. Louis' Double-A affiliate in the Texas League from 1996 to 1997. Mahler died at age 51 of a heart attack at home in Jupiter, Florida, where he was preparing for his second season as a minor league pitching coach for the New York Mets. He was survived by his wife, Sheryl, and five children Ricky, Robby, Timothy, Tyler and Shannon.",

He took the position on June 1, 1994, succeeding Deane Beman, who retired after nearly 20 years in the post. Finchem had previously served as Vice President of Business Affairs, Deputy Commissioner, and Chief Operating Officer of the Tour. Finchem graduated from Princess Anne High School in Virginia Beach, Virginia. He attended the University of Richmond on a debate scholarship, receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1969. He graduated from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1973. After practicing law in Virginia Beach for three years, Finchem served in the White House during the administration of Jimmy Carter as Deputy Advisor to the President in the Office of Economic Affairs in 1978 and 1979. In the early 1980s, Finchem co-founded the National Marketing and Strategies Group in Washington, D.C. As Commissioner, Finchem has greatly expanded the earnings opportunities for PGA Tour players both domestically and internationally. He has presided over the last three television broadcasting deals (1997, 2001 and 2005) and has maximized the earnings potential of the Tour, and perhaps none was as bold as the most recent deal that excludes ABC and ESPN and challenges the Golf Channel to get better. In 2006, the total PGA Tour purse was $256.8 million, up from $56.4 million in 1994. That remarkable growth has a lot to do with Tiger Woods, but Finchem's supporters also give him some of the credit. Finchem received the 2001 Old Tom Morris Award from the Golf Course Superintendents Association of America, GCSAA's highest honor. He is a single-figure handicap golfer.",

The son of a carpenter from Panadura, Dananjaya is another installment of Sri Lanka's long line of unorthodox spinners. Officially a left-hand batsman and an off-break bowler, he is said to have seven variations, including the leg-break, googly, carrom ball, doosra, and his stock off-spinner that had impressed national team captain Mahela Jayawardene so much in the nets as to make Jayawardene request him to be fast-tracked into the national squad. Dananjaya had at that point played no first-class, List A, T20, or even U-19 cricket. This in turn led to controversy as his selection was questioned by the media on the basis of a net performance. He was selected to play for Wayamba United in the inaugural Sri Lanka Premier League. In only his second match for the franchise, he took 3-18 against Nagenahira Nagas, consistently disturbing the batsmen with his flight, googly, and other variations. This in turn led to a place in the final squad for the 2012 ICC World Twenty20. In the 2013 IPL auctions, Dananjaya was sold to the Chennai Super Kings for his base price of $20,000.",

A former stonemason and later a motorcycle retailer in Grimsby, he was a stylish rider and five-time winner of the Isle of Man TT. Frith had the distinction of being one of the few to win TT races before and after the Second World War. He entered his first major race, the first Manx Grand Prix in 1930, riding an over-the-counter 350 cc Velocette KTT in the Junior event, finishing third at a speed of 60.34 mph. He retired from the 500 cc race with a blown engine, again riding his 350, when holding third place. He won the 1935 Junior Manx Grand Prix and then joined the Norton team for the 1936 TT races. It was a winning combination as he claimed the Junior TT and finished second in the Senior TT as well as winning the 350 cc European Championship. In 1937 he went one better in the Senior and took a brilliant win and setting the first 90 mph plus lap of the Snaefell Mountain Course. After finishing third in the 1939 Senior he missed the 1947 TT due to a practice spill on a 500 cc Moto Guzzi. Turning to Velocettes in 1948, he won the Junior race, repeating this success a year later. Freddie also has the distinction of being the first ever 350 cc World Champion in 1949 when he won all five events of the inaugural campaign. Frith, alongside other riders from BSA, Ariel and Matchless works teams, served in the army during World War II at the Infantry Driving & Maintenance School stationed at Keswick, where officers and NCOs learned how to ride cross-country.

        "wiki_bio_text": "Winnebago Deal are a rock music band from Oxford, United Kingdom. They started life in the late 1990s at Bartholomew School in Eynsham, with Ben Perrier (vocals, guitar) and Ben Thomas (then on guitar) writing songs, then recruiting a drummer and bass player through an ad. They played their first gig in early 1999 and fired the bass player a few months later, with Ben Thomas switching from guitar to bass. By the summer of 2000, Perrier and Thomas' dissatisfaction with their drummer led to his departure, with Thomas switching from bass to drums so the band could continue as a two-piece. Winnebago Deal now consists of two Bens, Ben Perrier (vocals, guitar) and Ben Thomas (drums).\n\nWinnebago Deal generated strong support from many appearances at Oxford's Zodiac Club, eventually supporting Fugazi at London's Forum; this led to their first record, the \"Plata o Plomo\" EP in 2003. They were nominated for the Kerrang Award's \"Best British Newcomer\" that year. Soon after, the band signed a recording contract with Double Dragon Music, and produced their debut album \"Dead Gone\" with Jack Endino, producer of the first Nirvana album \"Bleach\". \"Dead Gone\" was released in September 2004. \"Plata o Plomo\" was reissued in Australia later that year, with an expanded track listing.\n\nThe \"two Bens\" then went on to play as Mondo Generator with Nick Oliveri, former Queens of the Stone Age bassist-vocalist. As well as playing Mondo Generator gigs, they still toured as Winnebago Deal and even supported Mondo Generator, earning them the moniker \"Winnebago Generator\" from fans. After recording tracks at Dave Grohl's Studio 606 for the next Mondo Generator album with producer Nick Raskulinecz, it was announced in July 2006 that they had left the band for \"undisclosed reasons\". In that same month they released their second full-length album \"Flight of the Raven\", with the band again choosing to record with producer Jack Endino. The album features guest appearances from other artists including band partner Nick Oliveri, Endino, Paul Morrill and Edward \"Raven\" Heaton from the band Sicarios, and Rusty Needles of Oxford band Deguello, and was cited as the sixth best album in 2006 by \"Kerrang!\" writer Raziq Rauf.\n\nWinnebago Deal's third full-length album, \"Career Suicide\", was recorded in November 2009 and released a year later.",

He faced a 5-year ban from international cricket due to participating in an unofficial tour of South Africa. After retiring as a cricketer, he became a postman in Western Australia.",
        "wiki_bio_text": "Terence Michael Alderman (born 12 June 1956 in Subiaco, Western Australia, Australia) is a former Australian cricketer who played primarily as a right-arm fast-medium bowler of limited pace but nagging accuracy and movement. He began his first-class career in 1974 with Western Australia in the Sheffield Shield and came to international prominence when he was chosen for the Australian national team to tour England in 1981. In that series, he took 42 test wickets, including nine on debut, the biggest haul in a series since Jim Laker's 46 in 1956 and the fourth-highest total of all time. Alderman's 42 wickets is the record for the most wickets taken in a series without taking 10 wickets in a match. He was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in the Almanack's 1982 edition. He was disabled from playing for over a year by a shoulder injury sustained on 13 November 1982 when he rashly tackled an English-supporting ground invader at the WACA Ground in Perth. Alderman took part in an unofficial Australian tour of South Africa in 1985–86 and 1986–87, when that country was banned from test cricket as a Commonwealth anti-apartheid sanction. As a result, he received a 3-year ban from international cricket which disqualified him from playing in the 1985 Ashes series in England. Following his suspension, Alderman returned to the Australian side and resumed his success against England, taking 41 wickets in the 1989 Ashes series and another 16 in the 1990–91 series, his final Ashes appearance. He rarely enjoyed similar success against other countries. His final test series was against the West Indies in 1990–91, where he ended his career with 170 test wickets. He was a poor batsman, passing fifty just once in his career and averaging barely eight in first-class cricket. He had three seasons in English county cricket, with Kent (1984 and 1986) and then with Gloucestershire (1988). He now works as a courier for Mercury in Western Australia. On 28 July 2000, Alderman was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for being the all-time leading wicket taker for Western Australia. Alderman's sister Denise Emerson is married to former test umpire Ross Emerson and herself played seven tests for the Australian women's cricket team. Alderman is an alumnus of Aquinas College, Perth.",

She was asked to be part of the band by Allison Robertson, and agreed even though she did not have any experience. The band rehearsed every day in her garage. Before the release of The Donnas' album \"Gold Medal\", Castellano developed tendonitis. In October 2003, she had surgery for it. During her recovery, she had to take drum lessons to re-learn to hold drumsticks the correct way. For \"Gold Medal\", she recorded with her recovering wrists, but could only play for short periods of time. A shoulder problem forced Castellano to withdraw from The Donnas' tour following a show on December 27, 2008, at the House of Blues in Anaheim, CA. Amy Cesari of the band The Demonics filled in on future tour dates. On July 9, 2010, Castellano announced on the band's website that due to her shoulder she would have to retire from drumming and performing with The Donnas. Castellano still attended events the band was involved with as well as promoted the last album she recorded with the band, \"Greatest Hits Volume 16\". She attended Santa Monica College before transferring to Stanford University, where she was in the Class of 2013 and majored in Political Science.

            "Early in her childhood, she moved to Palo Alto, California, where she met her bandmates. She was asked to be part of the band by Allison Robertson, and agreed even though she did not have any experience. The band rehearsed every day in her garage.",
            "Before the release of The Donnas' album \"Gold Medal\", Castellano developed tendonitis. In October 2003, she had surgery for it. During her recovery, she had to take drum lessons to re-learn to hold drumsticks the correct way.",
            "For \"Gold Medal\", she recorded with her recovering wrists, but could only play for short periods of time. A shoulder problem forced Castellano to withdraw from The Donnas' tour following a show on December 27, 2008, at the House of Blues in Anaheim, CA.",
            "Amy Cesari of the band The Demonics filled in on future tour dates. On July 9, 2010, Castellano announced on the band's website that due to her shoulder she would have to retire from drumming and performing with The Donnas.",
            "Castellano still attended events the band was involved with as well as promoted the last album she recorded with the band, \"Greatest Hits Volume 16\". She attended Santa Monica College before transferring to Stanford University, where she was in the Class of 2013 and majored in Political Science.",
            "Castellano graduated from Stanford with distinction and will attend Harvard Law School starting in the fall of 2013."

After the coaches who had recruited him left the program, Threet announced in July 2007 that he was transferring to the University of Michigan under head coach Lloyd Carr.

After sitting out the 2007 season under NCAA transfer rules, the redshirt freshman Threet would go on to start at quarterback in eight of Michigan's 12 games. Later that same year, Threet transferred to Arizona State University, citing the incompatibility of his playing style as a traditional pro-style dropback passer with the spread offense of Rodriguez. After sitting out the 2009 season, Threet had two years of eligibility remaining with Arizona State. On August 30, 2010, Arizona State head coach Dennis Erickson announced that Threet would be the starting quarterback for the coming season.",

He was also capped once by the Scotland national football team. Baird was born in Rutherglen. Baird signed for Aberdeen before the Second World War, but the war started before he had made the first team. He joined the British Army, but was captured and held as a prisoner of war. He escaped and lived with an Italian family as their \"son\". In 1989, he published an autobiography, \"Family of Four\", which described these experiences. Baird returned to Aberdeen before the end of the war. His good form in this period earned him selection for Scotland in a friendly match against Belgium in early 1946. Baird was one of nine Scotland players making their international debut in the match, with only Jimmy Delaney having significant experience. Of those nine debutants, five players did not make another international appearance, including Baird. Baird helped Aberdeen win the Southern League Cup (a forerunner of the Scottish League Cup) in 1946 and the 1947 Scottish Cup, but his appearances were restricted by injuries. In all, he made 104 league appearances for Aberdeen, scoring 26 goals in those matches. He was transferred in 1953 to St. Johnstone, where he played for three seasons before retiring in 1956. After retiring as a player, Baird worked as a teacher and a sports journalist. Baird celebrated his 90th birthday in May 2009, and died quietly in his sleep on 3 November 2009.",

His personal name was Xiong Lü, ancestral name Mi (芈), and King Zhuang was his posthumous title. He became one of the Five Hegemons and attempted to wrest control of China from the King of Zhou. King Zhuang ascended the throne in 613 BC at a time when the kingdom of Chu was in disarray. For the first three years of his reign, Zhuang wasted time on excessive hunting and lavish partying. Several courtiers were anxious about the king, but none dared speak up as he had given orders that anyone who challenged his authority would be killed. When a particularly senior minister challenged him through a riddle, the king responded that he had been waiting for three years for someone from his court to show some nationalistic pride. The king made Sunshu Ao chancellor and began a series of reforms. Chu's agricultural output improved significantly during his reign, aided by Sunshu Ao's comprehensive dam-works and an enormous planned reservoir created in modern-day northern Anhui province. In 611 BC he annexed the state of Yong (庸国), a move which made Chu much stronger. After some overwhelming victories at the head of his army, King Zhuang attempted to take the place of King Ding of Zhou. He asked a messenger from Zhou about the weight of the nine tripod cauldrons which Zhou possessed, a euphemism for seeking ultimate power in China at the time, but was rebuffed. In the Battle of Bi, his army defeated the state of Jin, another strong state at that time. Later he achieved hegemony amongst some other states. His progress from lazy regent to a hegemon of his time gave rise to the Chinese four-character idiom of \"Yī Mǐng Jīng Rén\" (一冥而惊人).",

He dedicated over 40 years to translating the Latin treatise Hortus Malabaricus into English, unveiling its botanical insights. This translation, published 300 years after its original release, revealed the medicinal properties of ancient Indian plants, and he discovered 20 new plant species.",
        "wiki_bio_text": "Professor Kattungal Subramaniam Manilal (born 17 September 1938) is an Emeritus of the University of Calicut, a botany scholar and taxonomist, who devoted over 35 years of his life to research, translation, and annotation work of the Latin botanical treatise Hortus Malabaricus. This epic effort brought to light the main contents of the book, a wealth of botanical information on Malabar that had largely remained inaccessible to English-speaking scholars, because the entire text was in the Latin language. Despite the existence of Hendrik van Rheede's Hortus Malabaricus over the last three centuries, the correct taxonomic identity of many plants listed in Hortus Malabaricus, their medicinal properties, methods of use, etc., as described and codified by renowned traditional medical authorities of 17th century India remained inaccessible to English language-based scholars, until Manilal commenced publication of research papers and books on Hortus Malabaricus. Manilal's efforts ultimately resulted in an English edition of Hortus Malabaricus, for the first time, 325 years after its original publication from Amsterdam. The English edition contains a word-by-word translation of all the twelve volumes of the book, retaining the original style of language. Medicinal properties of plants are translated and interpreted, with commentaries on their Malayalam names given by van Rheede. In addition, the correct scientific identity of all plants, acceptable under ICBN, are set out along with their important synonyms and basionyms. Whilst the scope of Manilal's contributions to botany extend far beyond the research and publications around Hortus Malabaricus, his research work on Hortus Malabaricus alone are of botanical and socio-historic significance, and can be broadly classified under two heads: botanical and medicinal aspects of Hortus Malabaricus; and historical, political, social, and linguistic aspects of Hortus Malabaricus. Manilal has over 198 published research papers and 15 books to his credit as author and co-author. He and his associates have credits to discovering over 14 species of flowering plants, varieties, and combinations new to science. Manilal is the founder president of the Indian Association for Angiosperm Taxonomy (IAAT).",

She debuted as a senior gymnast in 2008, finishing 12th at the US Olympic Team Trials. In 2009, she secured gold on uneven bars at the Toyota International. Competing as a Florida Gator, she pursued elite gymnastics through 2012.",
        "wiki_bio_text": "Mackenzie Caquatto (born March 26, 1992) is an American artistic gymnast. She was formerly on the US National Team. Her younger sister, Bridgette Caquatto, was also an elite gymnast on the senior US National Team. She first qualified as an elite gymnast in 2007 and competed at the 2007 US National Championships, where she finished 17th. Mackenzie competed as a senior for the first time at the 2008 US National Championships and placed 10th overall. She was selected to be a member of her first national team and qualified for the 2008 US Olympic Team Trials, but competed only on the first day of competition, placing 12th in the all-around on that day.\n\nIn 2009, Caquatto competed at her first international meets as a member of the national team. Caquatto suffered a knee injury shortly after, but managed to place 5th at the 2009 US National Championships. She was then invited to the World Championships Selection Camp and was named as the first alternate for the team. In addition to her status as an alternate, she was sent to the Toyota International in Toyota City, Japan. At this competition, she competed on the uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise, winning the silver medal on the uneven bars with a score of 14.675, only behind world silver medalist on the event, Koko Tsurumi of Japan.\n\nCaquatto started her 2010 season by competing at the City of Jesolo Trophy, where she had the highest beam score but made mistakes on the floor which kept her from medaling in the all-around. Caquatto competed at the 2010 CoverGirl Classic and placed 3rd in the all-around, scoring the second highest on vault and the uneven bars but falling from the balance beam. She had qualified to compete at the 2010 US National Championships. At the 2010 US National Championships, Mackenzie placed 5th in the all-around. She fell on a simple change grip skill on the uneven bars, her best event, placing 4th. After the US Nationals, Mackenzie was selected to attend a selection camp for the 2010 World Championships. From there, she advanced to the second camp where she won the all-around competition. She was eventually selected to compete.\n\nAt the World Championships, Mackenzie competed in the all-around in the qualifying round. After hitting all her routines without major error, she placed 9th individually and 3rd with the team. Although the top 24 qualifiers advance to the individual all-around final, she was left out because fellow American athletes Aly Raisman and Rebecca Bross had qualified ahead of her and only two athletes from each country can qualify to a final. After the qualifying round, Mackenzie was selected to compete on the uneven bars and the vault during the team finals. She contributed a 14.666 on the bars and a 15.000 on the vault to help the team win the silver medal behind Russia and ahead of China.\n\nShe competed as a Florida Gator at the NCAA level for the 2010–2011 season, where she became injured but still competed in the all-around for her team at the NCAA Championships. After finishing the NCAA season, Mackenzie decided to train for a comeback to elite gymnastics for the 2011 season. Mackenzie began her 2011 elite season by competing at the CoverGirl Classic. At the classic, she competed a slightly watered down balance beam routine and a solid uneven bars routine, scoring 14.100 and 14.750, respectively.\n\nAt the 2011 US Visa National Championships, Mackenzie surprised many by competing in the all-around. On day 1 of the competition, Mackenzie was in second place after the two rotations; after scoring a 14.700 and 15.000 on vault and uneven bars, respectively. Unfortunately, she counted her first fall on the balance beam. After having a solid floor exercise, she finished her night in sixth place with an all-around score of 56.000. On the final day of competition, Mackenzie competed solidly on all her events. Taking advantage of injuries to defending national champion Rebecca Bross and Chellsie Memmel, Mackenzie went on to finish the championships in fourth place behind Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney, and champion Jordyn Wieber. She also took second place on the uneven bars just behind Wieber by 0.050.\n\nMackenzie was given a spot on her fourth national team and was invited to compete at the first World Team Selection Camp. She was considered to be a likely pick for the World Team, but injured her ankles when dismounting the beam at the selection camp and therefore lost her chance of going to Tokyo. After sitting out the beginning of the NCAA season, she competed on the uneven bars in early 2012 and is expected to reintroduce her beam routine soon.",

            "Caquatto started her 2010 season by competing at the City of Jesolo Trophy, where she had the highest beam score but made mistakes on the floor which kept her from medaling in the all-around.",
            "Caquatto competed at the 2010 CoverGirl Classic and placed 3rd in the all-around, scoring the second highest on vault and the uneven bars but falling from the balance beam. She had qualified to compete at the 2010 US National Championships.",

Known for her defensive prowess and baserunning, she once hit a record-breaking 50 stolen bases in a single season. Post-retirement, she taught and coached for 25 years.",
        "wiki_bio_text": "Twila Shively (March 20, 1920 – November 25, 1999) was an American competitive baseball player. An outfielder, she played from 1945 through 1950 in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Listed at 5'2\", 128 lb., she batted and threw right-handed. Shively spent five of her six years in the AAGPBL playing in the left field. A solid defensive player, she showed speed, good hands, an accurate throwing arm, and lived in a constant state of readiness. Routinely, she ranked among the top defensive outfielders in several categories, until a severe ankle injury limited her ability to perform, and she had to switch to first base. Offensively, she made consistent contact, knew when to take the extra base, and excelled as a basestealer.\n\nBorn in Decatur, Illinois, Twila Shively was the daughter of Glenn and Eva (née Bryant) Shively. She began playing softball at age eight and moved up in the softball ranks in Chicago as early as 1942. By then, she was featured in an article signed by Carl Guldager and published in the Chicago Daily News with the headline: \"She's Hedy Lamarr of Softball, Twila Shively Looks Like Model, Runs Bases Like Ty Cobb. Has Baseball Savvy Plus Pretty Face\". In 1944, Shively became a member of the Rockola Chicks team of the newly formed National Girls Baseball League. The NGBL was organized in Chicago to keep the best local players from migrating to the AAGPBL, which had been stabilized in 1943. After that, both circuits competed against each other to see who could associate itself with the biggest stars.\n\nShively entered the AAGPBL in 1945 with the Grand Rapids Chicks, playing for them three years before joining the Chicago Colleens (1948) and Peoria Redwings (1948–1950). In her rookie year, she formed part of a Chicks outfield that included Thelma Eisen in the center field and Elizabeth Wicken at right field. Shively collected a .196 batting average and a .276 on-base percentage in 106 games, driving in 23 runs and scoring 42 times, while her 46 stolen bases ranked her fifth in the league. She also led all outfielders with a .968 fielding percentage and finished second for the most putouts (234) behind Fort Wayne Daisies' Penny O'Brian (236). During the regular season, she achieved a career highlight, when she belted a two-out, walk-off grand slam to give her team the victory.\n\nHer most productive season came in 1946, when she posted career numbers in average (.247), runs scored (78), hits (101), runs batted in (45), steals (45), and games played (111). Considering the year was great for many pitchers, her numbers were quite respectable. Four no-hitters were recorded by Anna Mae Hutchison (Belles), Betty Luna (Blue Sox), Carolyn Morris (Peaches), and Amy Irene Applegren (Lassies), while Connie Wisniewski (Chicks) and Dorothy Wiltse (Daisies) topped the league in earned run average with 0.81 and 0.83, respectively. As a result, more than half of the circuit's players averaged under .200. Dorothy Kamenshek (Peaches) was the only hitter to reach the .300 mark (.316).\n\nFollowing her baseball career, Shively graduated from Illinois State Normal and Indiana University and worked as a physical education teacher at Washington High School in South Bend, Indiana. She also coached the school's softball and volleyball teams to city championships, inspiring children for almost 30 years. Twila Shively died in Douglas, Michigan on Thanksgiving Day, 1999 at the age of 79, after suffering four years of Alzheimer's disease and a year-long fight with lung cancer. She is part of the AAGPBL permanent display at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum at Cooperstown, New York, unveiled in 1988, which is dedicated to the entire league rather than any individual personality.",

In Nagano, where he finished in 12th position, he broke his own world junior record to a new best time of 1:51.47, which was 0.78 of a second faster. He also finished in 29th position at the 5000 m. In November 1998, he broke the junior world record over 500 m into a new time of 36.30 in Calgary and a day later he broke his own 1500 m record again; this time 1:49.71 was his new best time. Due to these records and some other decent results in that same weekend, he also broke the junior world record for the small allround classification to 153.689 points. That same season, he won the bronze medal at the World Junior Allround Championships and broke another two world records. He set 1:10.87 at the 1000 m in February 1999 and a total of 143.965 points for the sprint classification again in Calgary. As a senior, during his second Olympic Games, the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, he finished 17th at the 500 m, 12th at the 1000 m, and 21st at the 1500 m. He also represented South Korea four years later during the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. In Italy, he achieved his all-time best Olympic result, by becoming 8th at the 500 m. He also became 17th at the 1000 m.",

        "wiki_bio_text": "Tommy Nutter (17 April 1943 – 17 August 1992) was a British tailor, famous for reinventing the Savile Row suit in the 1960s. Born in Barmouth, Merioneth to Christopher Nutter and Dorothy (formerly Banister), he was raised in Edgware, Middlesex, where his father owned a local high street café. After the family moved to Kilburn, Nutter and his brother David attended Willesden Technical College. Nutter initially studied plumbing and then architecture, but he abandoned both aged 19 to study tailoring at the Tailor and Cutter Academy. In the early 1960s, he joined traditional tailors Donaldson, Williamson & Ward. After seven years, in 1969, he joined up with Edward Sexton to open \"Nutters of Savile Row\" at No. 35a Savile Row. They were financially backed by Cilla Black and her husband Bobby Willis, managing director of the Beatles' Apple Corps Peter Brown, and lawyer James Vallance-White. The business was an immediate success, as Nutter combined traditional tailoring skills with innovative design. He designed for the Hardy Amies range, and then for the man himself. His clients included his investors, plus Sir Roy Strong, Mick Jagger, Bianca Jagger and Elton John. Nutter himself was most proud of the fact that, for the cover of the Beatles' album \"Abbey Road\" in 1969, he dressed three out of the four: George Harrison elected to be photographed on the road-crossing in denims.\n\nIn the 1970s, his bespoke business became less successful, but he branched out into ready-to-wear clothing, marketed through Austin Reed. He also successfully expanded into East Asia, establishing the Savile Row brand in Japan. In 1976, Sexton bought Nutter out of the business. Nutter went to work for Kilgour French and Stanbury, managing his own workroom. Sexton continued to run Nutters of Savile Row until 1983, when Nutter returned to the Row with a ready-to-wear shop: \"Tommy Nutter, Savile Row\". (This new venture, which traded at No. 19 Savile Row until Tommy's death, was backed by J&J Crombie Limited, who continue to own the \"Tommy Nutter\" trademark.) At this time, Sexton set up a business in his own name. In the 1980s, he described his suits as a \"cross between the big-shouldered 'Miami Vice' look and the authentic Savile Row.\" He created the clothing of the Joker worn by Jack Nicholson in the 1989 film \"Batman\". Nutter died in 1992 at the Cromwell Hospital in London of complications from AIDS.",

Born in Yonkers, New York, Ridzik was signed by the Phillies at the age of 16 and made his Major League debut on September 4, 1950, pitching in relief. In 1951, Ridzik started 12 games and relieved in 30 more, going 9-6 with an earned run average of 3.77. The Phillies traded him on April 30, 1952, along with Smoky Burgess and Stan Palys, to the Cincinnati Redlegs for Andy Seminick, Glen Gorbous, and Jim Greengrass. After having his contract sold to Seattle of the Pacific Coast League that same year, the New York Giants claimed him the next month in the Rule 5 Draft. Ridzik pitched for the Giants from 1952 to 1957, appearing in 56 games including 5 starts. On April 8, 1958, the Giants sold his contract to the Cleveland Indians, where he would pitch in six more games before his contract was sold again to the Chicago Cubs. He would not pitch a Major League game with the Cubs before his contract was sold to the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League. Ridzik signed with the Washington Senators three years later in 1961 after developing a knuckleball. He would appear in 132 games, mostly in relief, over the next three years for the Senators. On April 13, 1964, his contract was sold back to his original team, the Phillies. He would appear in two games with the Phillies that year before calling it a career. After life as a baseball player, Ridzik worked in the Washington D.C. area for a military food distributor until moving to Florida in the late 1980s. In Florida, he helped with the organizing of charity events featuring former Major League players. He also helped establish the Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association with former Senators teammate, Chuck Hinton. He died on January 8, 2008, after fighting heart disease for several years.",

However, as the band moved from a five-piece to a two-piece, their sound moved away from the angular sound of previous records and closer to a more melodic heavy composition structure with sing-a-long choruses. The current two-piece sound can be attributed to influences such as Dirty Projectors, Beirut, and Grizzly Bear.

In 2006, producer and engineer Scott Solter (who has worked with John Vanderslice and The Mountain Goats) remixed the 2005 album Stowaway, which he had also recorded. This remix was considered unique due to its exclusivity to analog processes. Solter is credited on the album with \"machines, razors, tape\".

Known for resisting bureaucratic corruption, he founded the first Nirmithi Kendra in London, which sparked the global National Building Centre Movement. As National Museum administrator, he achieved a 60-day transformation, earning accolades from the United Nations for sustainable development.",
        "wiki_bio_text": "C.V. Ananda Bose is an Indian civil servant who served in the Indian Administrative Service. He is notable for not yielding to the corrupt system of the Indian bureaucracy. An eminent administrator, writer, orator, and innovator, Dr. C.V. Ananda Bose pioneered pathbreaking administrative innovations in rural development, affordable housing, eco-tourism development, redressal of public grievances, women's empowerment, development of weaker sections of society, and promotion of art and culture. The innovations have found expression in various developmental programmes that have been executed at the district, state, and national levels in India.\n\nIt was in the area of low-cost housing that Dr. Bose pioneered a movement that won international acclaim. He set up the first Nirmithi Kendra (building centre) in the country in the Kollam district, which became the institutional mechanism for the propagation of cost-effective, environment-friendly (CEEF) building technology. This was positively evaluated by the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances, Government of India (1993). Based on the Kollam model, the Government of India launched the National Building Centre Movement to replicate Nirmithi Kendras (building centres) in every district of the country. The Nirmithi Movement was adjudged by the United Nations as one of the global best practices in the field of sustainable human settlement development.\n\nEarly in his career, Dr. Bose introduced the \"Gramotsava\" programme in Kerala, wherein the local people were encouraged to actively participate in the village development planning. The initiative, launched in the Kasargode district of Kerala in the 1980s, was subsequently implemented in 200 panchayats across the state. Dr. Bose also founded the District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC) in the Kollam district during his tenure as Collector. The Council generated high tourism interest in the region and created new job opportunities for the local people. The Government of Kerala subsequently set up similar councils in all 14 districts of the state. DTPs have made perceptible contributions in positioning Kerala as \"God's own country\".\n\nHe later pioneered an eco-village programme in the Mannanan village of the Kottayam district of Kerala, wherein the family clusters were encouraged to pursue activities such as organic farming, soil and water conservation through traditional methods, floriculture, horticulture, vermiculture, generation of energy from non-conventional sources, homestead forestry, etc., with institutional support, governmental assistance, and financial support from different agencies.\n\nAs Chairman of the Atomic Energy Education Society, Mumbai, Dr. Bose introduced and reinforced the concept of alternative education, wherein people could pursue studies in disciplines in which they did not have prior academic backgrounds. He founded the Institute of Alternative Education. He also launched the ASTER Project (Application of Science & Technology in Educational Reforms) which sought to alter the mode of academic delivery through the application of information and communication technology (ICT).\n\nAs Managing Director of NAFED, Dr. Bose initiated a few innovative programmes which helped control the price spiral during 2009-10. Christened as \"Farm Gate to Home Gate\", this innovation sought to buy agricultural produce directly from the farmers for distribution among the consumers, taking only marginal profit. Spurred by the success of this pilot programme in New Delhi, the Easy Market Scheme was envisaged for price control in the rest of the country.\n\nAs the administrator of the National Museum, Dr. Bose launched a 100-day programme which spelt out specific measures to revamp and revitalise the institution. Most of the improvements suggested were achieved in 60 days, such as opening the closed-down galleries, modernising the display and lighting, launching outreach programmes to take the museum to the community, arranging children's programmes to ignite young minds to the greatness of India's national heritage, organising international exhibitions, and launching the People's Museum Movement, to mention a few.\n\nPursuit of excellence was always central to Dr. Bose's role in public administration. His contributions were seldom circumscribed by the call of duty. Instead, he has been engaged in continuous research and field experimentation in developing the most appropriate, people-first solutions. He also took key steps to synergise the various government programmes and schemes to create comprehensive, sustainable, and inclusive administrative mechanisms that have since been replicated in multiple domains.\n\nIn recognition of this remarkable turnaround of the museum management and the perceptible makeover of the institution, the Government of India asked Dr. Bose to continue with this mission even after his retirement from service.",

He was born in Palatine Bridge, Montgomery County, New York and attended Catholic schools, taught school in Montgomery County (1900–1903), and was a prospector/miner in Alaska (1904–1912) before studying law and beginning practice in Valdez (1913). Dimond's political experience includes: US Commissioner in Chisana, Alaska (1913–1914); Special Assistant US Attorney for the 3rd Judicial Division of Alaska in Valdez (1917); Mayor of Valdez (1920–1922, 1925–1932); Alaska Territorial Senate (1923–1926, 1929–1932); and District Judge for the 3rd Division of Alaska (1945–1953). He also served as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1936 and 1940. He died on May 28, 1953 in Anchorage. A Roman Catholic, Dimond was a member of organizations such as the Elks, Moose, and Eagles. His secretary, Bob Bartlett, eventually became a United States Senator from Alaska. Today, November 30 is celebrated by the state of Alaska as \"Anthony Dimond Day\". In Anchorage, A. J. Dimond High School and Dimond Boulevard, a major thoroughfare, are named after him.

In 1954, Saint and four others were killed while trying to evangelize the Huaorani tribe during Operation Auca. Born in 1923, his adventurous spirit was shaped by early flights with his brother. A film about his life, \"Through the Gates of Splendor,\" was released in 2007.",
        "wiki_bio_text": "Nate Saint (August 30, 1923 - January 8, 1956) was an evangelical Christian missionary pilot to Ecuador who, along with four others, was killed while attempting to evangelize the Huaorani people through efforts known as Operation Auca. Nate Saint was born in 1923. When he was seven, he took his first plane ride with his brother Sam, who would eventually become a commercial pilot for American Airlines. While in the airplane, he discovered a love of flying. His family was somewhat unusual; his brothers made a sleeping patio on the roof of their home, and his dad built a roller coaster in the backyard.\n\nWhen he joined the army, he was stationed in Las Vegas, NV, but was transferred to several other locations over the years. A leg injury from a sledding accident caused him some problems while he was in the army. About a year before he was discharged, he almost died while climbing a mountain in Yosemite National Park. After that incident, he learned to live life to the fullest.\n\nIn September 1955, Nate was joined by his teammates, Jim Elliot, Ed McCully, Pete Fleming, and Roger Youderian. Saint finally found a settlement of the Huaorani, also known as Aucas, while searching by air. To reach the tribe, Saint and the team lowered gifts to the Huaorani in a bucket tied to the plane. The Huaorani were widely feared by other Ecuadoreans, because they combined a desire to be left alone with a willingness to use force; they attacked and killed any intruders without provocation. Nevertheless, the tribe was excited on receiving the gifts and gave some gifts back.\n\nFinally, the missionaries decided to try to meet the Huaorani on the ground; and, on January 3, 1956, using the beach as a landing strip, they set up camp four miles from the Huaorani settlement. Their initial contact was encouraging; however, on Sunday, January 8, 1956, the entire team was killed on the beach (known as \"Palm Beach\") when armed Huaorani met and speared them.\n\nSaint and the other four men became famous worldwide as a result. \"Life\" magazine published a 10-page photo essay on the story, which was also covered in Reader's Digest and many other publications. Today, a small school for missionary children in Shell, Ecuador, bears Nate Saint's name. Rachel Saint, Nate's sister, continued the mission efforts to the Huaorani, which eventually came to fruition. This resulted in many of these natives becoming Christians, including those who had killed Saint.\n\nIn 1966, Marjorie (Marj) Farris Saint married Abe Van Der Puy, president of HCJB World Radio. Abe died in 2003; and Marj died in 2004, from cancer. She is buried in Hillcrest Memorial Gardens, south of Ocala, Florida. Nate's older son, Steve Saint, spent time as a child visiting his missionary family members and friends and getting to know the Huaorani. Steve was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ by Mincaye, who was the very man who killed his father but later converted to Christ. Steve Saint now works with the Huaorani people and travels around the world, preaching the gospel, often accompanied by Mincaye.\n\nA documentary based on the story, \"Through the Gates of Splendor\", was released in 2005. The following year, a feature film, \"End of the Spear\", was released on January 20, a week and a half after the 50-year anniversary of the killings. Steve Saint also helped write \"Jungle Pilot\", based on his father's diary about his time in Ecuador and work with the Huaorani Indians.",

He was also the studio engineer of choice for Crass Records and was often considered to be the band's \"ninth member\". Loder was born near Plymouth and educated at boarding school before studying electrical engineering at London's City University. During his post-graduate work there, he became involved in early experiments in digital encoding of audio for the military. By 1970, he had joined Exit, alongside Penny Rimbaud, utilizing a one-track tape-recorder. This led to Loder eventually founding a record studio in his garage after the disbanding of Exit in 1974.\n\nLoder was recording advertising jingles in 1977 when his path crossed once again with Rimbaud, who had by then co-founded Crass, and at this point invited Loder to become the band's engineer and financial manager, roles Loder happily accepted. When Crass founded their own record label, Loder worked as an engineer on most of the label's releases, and when Loder saw potential in a number of bands turned away by Crass Records due to ideological differences, he set up Southern Records. Loder engineered and produced for many bands other than Crass, among them The Jesus and Mary Chain, for whom he engineered the recordings of the \"Psychocandy\" album, Big Black's \"Songs About Fucking\", PJ Harvey, Babes in Toyland, Fugazi, Ministry, and Shellac.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Loder established a television production facility at Southern. Its notable output included the music show \"Snub TV\", which after first being syndicated nationwide in the USA, went on to further success on BBC2 and in other countries. Loder was responsible for encouraging and establishing independent alternative internet ezines, donating the use of Southern's servers and bandwidth, taking part in pioneering online media streaming and simulcasting.

A career scientist turned reluctant politician, Kalam was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), and was intimately involved in India's civilian space program and military missile development efforts. He thus came to be known as the \"Missile Man of India\" for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.

Widely referred to as the \"People's President,\" he returned to his civilian life of education, writing, and public service after a single term.

Most of the Gilbertine houses were lesser establishments which should have been dissolved under the Suppression of Religious Houses Act 1535 (only four out of twenty-six houses had revenues over £200 a year). However, Holgate is credited with using his influence to save them for a few years. For example, Malton Priory, one of the lesser Gilbertine houses, was the last of them to surrender in December 1539, whereas Sempringham Priory, worth more than £200 a year, surrendered in 1538.\n\nIn 1550 Holgate married Barbara Wentworth, who was about 25 at the time. This may, however, have been a second marriage to make it fully legal, and Holgate and Wentworth may have first married in late 1547 with Roger Tongue officiating. In 1551 Arthur Norman claimed that he was already married to Barbara Wentworth, but the courts decided that their marriage when she was about seven had not been a binding legal transaction. Robert and Barbara remained married until 1553, when shortly after Mary I of England came to the throne she imprisoned Holgate on various charges, with his being a married clergy being central to these. In 1554 Holgate renounced his marriage claiming he had only entered it to avoid suspicion as a papist.\n\nIn January 1555 Holgate was released from prison, but he was not restored to priestly office. He died later that year. In 1558 a Robert Holgate from Yorkshire entered the University of Cambridge. He may have been a son of Holgate, since there are some claims he had two children by Barbara, but there is no conclusive evidence on the matter.",

He led a jihad into the region of Fumbina (in modern-day Cameroon and Nigeria), opening the region for Fulani colonisation. As a result of Adamu's constant warring, the Fulani today make up the largest ethnic group in northern Cameroon (at more than 60% of the region's entire population, which, considering the fact that they weren't from the area, is a remarkable feat), and Islam is the dominant religion. The wars also forced many peoples south into the forest region. Adamu studied in Hausaland and earned the title \"Modibo\" (\"Lettered One\") for his scholarship. Upon finishing his studies, he returned home to Gurin and learned of the jihad declared by Fulani mystic Usman dan Fodio. When he accompanied a delegation to visit Usman, the leader ordered Adamu to extend his jihad east as \"Lamido Fumbina\" (Ruler of the Southlands). Adamu raised an army and attacked Bata settlements near Gurin. He took the villages, and many more traditional Fulbe leaders and new soldiers came to his side. He next took on Mandara, the largest and best organised state in the region. He swept over several smaller settlements and eventually conquered the Mandara capital, Dulo, with ease. While his men celebrated, however, the Mandara army counterattacked and recaptured the town. Though he fought many more campaigns, Adamu now spent most of his time in Yola, which became his capital. He set about creating the administrative structure of his new state, which he named Adamawa after himself. Adamu ruled the empire, subordinate only to Usman dan Fodio in Sokoto. Below him lay the heads of major settlements, known as Lamibe (singular: Lamido). The village formed the smallest unit of government. Upon Adamu's death in 1847, his son Muhammadu Lawal became Lamido of Adamawa. The empire was not to last, however, as colonial battles and division eventually destroyed the independent Fulani state. The conquest had long-term repercussions, however. The Fulani became the dominant ethnic group in the region, and Islam the major religion. The herdsmen altered the land to be more suitable for herding cattle, their primary pursuit.

Although he began writing at a young age and was already the author of six books at 25 years old, which were largely influenced by fascist ideals and later rejected by Brancati himself, critics tend to set the starting point of his career in 1935, when he released the collection of short stories In Search of a Cause.\n\nBrancati achieved his first and probably most significant success in 1941 with the novel Don Giovanni in Sicily, a vibrant and humorous portrait of the Sicilian temperament. In 1944 he wrote the novel Gli Anni Perduti (The Lost Years), a bold satire of Benito Mussolini's megalomania, and in 1946 Vecchio con gli Stivali (Old Man in Boots), a satirical short story inspired by the vicissitudes of Italian fascism, which won the Vendemmia Award and was adapted into a successful film, Difficult Years, by Luigi Zampa. In 1950 he won the Bagutta Prize with another well-known novel, Il Bell'Antonio (The Handsome Antonio).\n\nHe died in a clinic in Turin after a major surgery.

            " Although he began writing at a young age and was already the author of six books at 25 years old, which were largely influenced by fascist ideals and later rejected by Brancati himself, critics tend to set the starting point of his career in 1935, when he released the collection of short stories In Search of a Cause.",
            "Brancati achieved his first and probably most significant success in 1941 with the novel Don Giovanni in Sicily, a vibrant and humorous portrait of the Sicilian temperament.",
            " In 1944 he wrote the novel Gli Anni Perduti (The Lost Years), a bold satire of Benito Mussolini's megalomania, and in 1946 Vecchio con gli Stivali (Old Man in Boots), a satirical short story inspired by the vicissitudes of Italian fascism, which won the Vendemmia Award and was adapted into a successful film, Difficult Years, by Luigi Zampa.",
            "In 1950 he won the Bagutta Prize with another well-known novel, Il Bell'Antonio (The Handsome Antonio).",

He is best known for his tenures as manager of the Chicago White Sox, Oakland Athletics, and St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball (MLB). His MLB career has spanned from 1963 to the present. As a manager, La Russa guided his teams to three World Series titles, six league championships, and twelve division titles in 33 seasons.

Following his playing career, he earned a Juris Doctor degree from Florida State University.\n\nLa Russa was named manager of the White Sox in the middle of the 1979 season and guided the White Sox to an American League West Division title four seasons later. Despite being fired in the middle of the 1986 season, the Athletics hired him less than three weeks later, and La Russa led the A's to three consecutive American League championships from 1988 to 1990 and the 1989 World Series title. He left Oakland following the 1995 season to manage the Cardinals, and led the team to three National League championships and the 2011 World Series title.

Wood made her debut as a leading film actress at the age of nine in \"Digging to China\" (1998) and became well known after her transition to a more adult-oriented, Golden Globe-nominated role in the teen drama film \"Thirteen\" (2003). Wood continued acting mostly in independent films, including \"Pretty Persuasion\" (2005), \"Down in the Valley\" (2006), \"Running with Scissors\" (2006), and in the big studio production \"Across the Universe\" (2007). Since 2008, Wood has appeared in more mainstream films, including \"The Wrestler\" (2008), \"Whatever Works\" (2009), and \"The Ides of March\" (2011). She has also returned to television, playing the supporting role of Queen Sophie-Anne on \"True Blood\" from 2009 to 2011 and playing Kate Winslet's daughter in the HBO miniseries \"Mildred Pierce\" (2011), a role for which she was nominated for the Golden Globe and Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Her personal life, particularly her relationship with Marilyn Manson, to whom she was previously engaged, has attracted press attention. In 2012, she married English actor Jamie Bell, with whom she has one son. They separated in 2014.",

        "wiki_bio_text": "Daniel Eckford Stearns (born October 17, 1861 in Buffalo, New York - June 28, 1944 in Glendale, California), commonly known as \"Ecky\" Stearns, was a Major League Baseball first baseman. He played for the Buffalo Bisons, Detroit Wolverines, Kansas City Cowboys, Baltimore Orioles, and Cincinnati Red Stockings (AA). At the start of the 1882 season, clubs playing in the American Association had their players wear non-matching silk uniforms, with a different color and/or pattern corresponding to each position in the field. Accordingly, on opening day for the Red Stockings, Stearns wore an unusual candy-striped jersey. On September 11, 1882, Stearns was involved in a notable milestone, when pitcher Tony Mullane of the Louisville Eclipse pitched the first no-hit game in the history of the American Association against Stearns and his teammates on the Cincinnati Red Stockings, a 2-0 win by Louisville. Stearns made the game's final out by bouncing into a fielder's choice that forced runner Pop Snyder at second base. The Red Stockings had the last laugh, however, ending the year as the AA's inaugural champions. Unsatisfied with their first-base play in 1882, the Red Stockings signed Long John Reilly of the New York Metropolitans to replace Stearns prior to the 1883 season. Stearns spent the 1887 season with the Topeka Golden Giants of the Western League, leading that league in hits. That team finished with a dominant record of 90-25, and is sometimes described as the strongest minor league baseball club of the 19th century. Stearns is also notable as one of the first Jews to play Major League Baseball. His status as such made him popular with Jewish youths who were fans of the game.",

            "On September 11, 1882, Stearns was involved in a notable milestone, when pitcher Tony Mullane of the Louisville Eclipse pitched the first no-hit game in the history of the American Association against Stearns and his teammates on the Cincinnati Red Stockings, a 2-0 win by Louisville.",
            "Stearns made the game's final out by bouncing into a fielder's choice that forced runner Pop Snyder at second base. The Red Stockings had the last laugh, however, ending the year as the AA's inaugural champions.",
            "Unsatisfied with their first-base play in 1882, the Red Stockings signed Long John Reilly of the New York Metropolitans to replace Stearns prior to the 1883 season. Stearns spent the 1887 season with the Topeka Golden Giants of the Western League, leading that league in hits.",
            "That team finished with a dominant record of 90-25, and is sometimes described as the strongest minor league baseball club of the 19th century. Stearns is also notable as one of the first Jews to play Major League Baseball.",
            "His status as such made him popular with Jewish youths who were fans of the game."

        "wiki_bio_text": "John Walls Cushnahan (born 23 July 1948) is a former politician in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland who served as leader of the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland and then as a Member of the European Parliament for Fine Gael. Cushnahan was educated at St Mary's Christian Brothers Grammar School and Queen's University, Belfast, and worked as a teacher before going into politics. He worked as General Secretary of the Alliance Party from 1974 until 1982 and was a member of Belfast City Council between 1977 and 1985. In 1982, he was elected to the prior Assembly for North Down and two years later he became the new leader of Alliance, succeeding Oliver Napier. During his tenure as leader, he sought to strengthen the party's links with the British Liberal Party. The Anglo Irish Agreement was signed during this period and Cushnahan faced the difficult position of giving Alliance support to it and facing the united opposition of the Unionist parties. However, when the Assembly was dissolved in 1986, Cushnahan found it financially difficult to remain in politics and so stood down as leader in 1987 to be succeeded by John Alderdice. Two years later, Cushnahan made a surprise political comeback when he moved to the Republic of Ireland and stood as a Fine Gael candidate in the 1989 election to the European Parliament, winning a seat in the Munster constituency. He was an MEP for fifteen years before retiring at the 2004 elections. Cushnahan now serves as a board member of the peace and reconciliation charity Co-operation Ireland.",

In addition to providing backing vocals, Meagher sang lead on occasion, as on \"They'll Make You Cry,\" a song from the band's 1965 debut album, Introducing the Beau Brummels. Meagher appeared with the band in the 1965 science-fiction/comedy movie Village of the Giants, which was featured in a 1994 episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. He remained with the band as it reduced from a quintet to a trio by 1967's critically acclaimed album Triangle. During the recording of the band's next album, 1968's Bradley's Barn, Meagher was drafted, becoming one of the few musicians from a well-known rock band to serve in the military at the height of the Vietnam War. After he was discharged two years later, Meagher played in the Black Velvet Band with former Beau Brummels bandmate Declan Mulligan. Over the next three decades, Meagher has also participated in several Beau Brummels revivals, most notably in the mid-1970s when the band released a 1975 self-titled reunion album.",

            "During his time with the Indianapolis Colts, he drafted Hall of Famer Marshall Faulk and future Hall of Famer Marvin Harrison. He also drafted Ken Dilger, Tarik Glenn, and Adam Meadows, who would be cornerstones of the Colts' offensive line.",
            "He also built a team in Indianapolis with Jim Harbaugh, who in 1995 led the NFL in passing and had a very successful run in the 1995 NFL playoffs, including the first playoff win for the Colts since Super Bowl V, a span of thirty years.",
            "He drafted Ray Buchanan and Ashley Ambrose, who came to be tremendous players in the league and eventually started for the Falcons in the Super Bowl. It could be argued that Bill Tobin laid the foundation for the Peyton Manning era because of the quality players he drafted.",

        "wiki_bio_text": "William Luther Pierce III (September 11, 1933 – July 23, 2002) was a prominent American white nationalist and political activist. He was one of the most influential ideologues of the white nationalist movement for some 30 years before his death. A physicist by profession, he was also an author under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald of the novels The Turner Diaries and Hunter. Pierce founded the National Alliance, a major white nationalist organization, which he led for almost thirty years.\n\nBorn in Atlanta, Georgia, to a Presbyterian family of Scots-Irish and English descent, Pierce was descended from the aristocracy of the Old South, being a descendant of Thomas H. Watts, the Governor of Alabama and Attorney General of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. As a child, Pierce did well academically, graduating from high school in 1952. He received a baccalaureate in physics from Rice University in 1955, earned a doctorate from University of Colorado at Boulder in 1962, and became an assistant professor of physics at the Oregon State University in 1962, where he joined the anti-communist John Birch Society.\n\nIn 1965, in order to finance his political ambitions, he left his tenure at Oregon State University and became a senior researcher for the aerospace manufacturer Pratt & Whitney in New Haven, Connecticut. In 1966 Pierce moved to the Washington, D.C. area and became an associate of George Lincoln Rockwell, who was assassinated in 1967, after which Pierce became co-leader of the National Youth Alliance, which split in 1974, with Pierce founding the National Alliance. Pierce intended the National Alliance to be a political vanguard that would ultimately bring about a white nationalist revolution in the United States.\n\nIn 1978, Pierce wrote, under the pseudonym \"Andrew Macdonald\", the novel The Turner Diaries, which depicts a violent revolution in the United States which leads to the overthrow of the United States federal government. In 1984, he wrote another novel, Hunter, which portrays the actions of a Vietnam veteran F-4 Phantom II pilot and Washington, D.C.-area defense department consultant who embarks on a plan to assassinate interracial couples and liberal journalists, politicians and bureaucrats in the D.C. area.\n\nIn 1985, Pierce relocated the headquarters of the National Alliance to Hillsboro, West Virginia, where he founded the Cosmotheist Community Church to receive tax exemption for his organization. Pierce spent the rest of his life in West Virginia hosting a weekly radio show, \"American Dissident Voices\", publishing the internal newsletter National Alliance Bulletin (formerly called Action), and overseeing his publications, National Vanguard Magazine (originally titled Attack!), Free Speech and Resistance, as well as books published by his publishing firm National Vanguard Books, Inc. and music produced by his record company, Resistance Records.\n\nIn 2002, Pierce suddenly died of cancer. At the time, the National Alliance was bringing in more than $1 million a year, with more than 1,500 members and a paid national staff of 17 full-time officials, and was better known than at any time in its history, after which it entered a period of internal conflict and decline. His works, however, continue to enjoy a notable audience.",

Following an inquiry carried out by the European Anti-Fraud Office, Wise was formally charged with false accounting and money laundering by Bedfordshire Police. After initially pleading not guilty, he admitted the charges and was sentenced in November 2009 at Southwark Crown Court to a two-year term of imprisonment. He is thought to be the first MEP to be jailed for expenses fraud. Sentencing him, the judge said that Wise had engaged in \"deliberate and blatant dishonesty\" and had set about to defraud the European Parliament almost as soon as he was elected.",

        "wiki_bio_text": "Richard Michael \"Kip\" Carpenter (14 August 1929 – 26 February 2012) was an English television screenwriter, author, and actor who created a number of British television series, including \"Robin of Sherwood\" and \"Catweazle\". Born in King's Lynn, Norfolk, Carpenter attended the Old Vic Theatre School before starting an acting career by working in rep. He appeared in occasional films, but was mostly active on British TV in the 1960s as a character player, on one occasion opposite Tony Hancock in one of his last shows for the BBC, commonly known as \"The Bowmans\". Other TV shows in which he appeared in the 1960s included \"Z-Cars\", \"Dixon of Dock Green\", and \"Gideon's Way\".\n\nIn 1969, Carpenter created \"Catweazle\", the children's series about an unfortunate wizard from the 11th century who is accidentally transported to the present day. This changed the course of his career substantially. Carpenter earned international recognition and a Writers Guild Award for creating the cult children's TV series.\n\nDuring the 1970s, he wrote the series \"The Ghosts of Motley Hall\" (1976–78), \"Dick Turpin\" (1979–82), parts of the series \"The Famous Five\" and \"Doctor Snuggles\", and seventeen episodes of \"The Adventures of Black Beauty\" for ITV companies; and \"Cloud Burst\", \"The Boy from Space\", and \"The King's Dragon\" as part of BBC's \"Look and Read\" (1967–2004) programme for schools, some episodes of which he also presented.\n\nIn the 1980s came the historical adventures \"Smuggler\" and its later antipodean-based follow-up \"Adventurer\", and between them, the lavish HTV production \"Robin of Sherwood\", which ran for three series. Carpenter then worked on a number of series for children and families in the 1990s (\"The Winjin' Pom\", \"Stanley's Dragon\", and \"Out of Sight\"), some of which (\"The Borrowers\", \"The Return of the Borrowers\", and \"The Scarlet Pimpernel\") were based on classic novels.\n\nCarpenter wrote novelisations of many of the early series he created: \"Catweazle\", \"Cloud Burst\", \"The Ghosts of Motley Hall\", \"Smuggler\", \"Robin of Sherwood\" (two books), and two books of \"Dick Turpin\". Carpenter died from a pulmonary embolism on 26 February 2012 at the age of 82.",

Brown found himself with the American Association's Orioles in the 1886 season in a similar role for a brief period of time. He pitched in four games, completing and losing each one for a record of 0-4 and an ERA of 5.68. He also appeared in one game as a second baseman. Brown was 3-for-19 at the plate in 1886 to finish his career with a batting average of exactly .200 (16-for-80). Brown died on June 28, 1888 in his birthplace of Warren, Pennsylvania, aged just 29.",

After winning the California and South Dakota primary elections for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States, Kennedy was shot as he walked through the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel and died in the Good Samaritan Hospital twenty-six hours later. Sirhan Sirhan, a 24-year-old Palestinian/Jordanian immigrant, was convicted of Kennedy's murder and is serving a life sentence for the crime. The shooting was recorded on audio tape by a freelance newspaper reporter, and the aftermath was captured on film. Kennedy's body lay in repose at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York for two days before a funeral mass was held on June 8. His body was interred near his brother John at Arlington National Cemetery. His death prompted the protection of presidential candidates by the United States Secret Service. Hubert Humphrey went on to win the Democratic nomination for the presidency, but ultimately lost the election to Richard Nixon. As with his brother John's death, Kennedy's assassination and the circumstances surrounding it have spawned a variety of conspiracy theories. As of 2015, Kennedy remains one of only two sitting United States Senators to be assassinated, the other being Huey Long.",

Initially a touring guitarist for Aldo Nova, he collaborated with Eric Martin and Steve Perry. Taylor declined to rejoin Winger for their 2007 reunion album due to prior commitments in television music composition.",
        "wiki_bio_text": "Paul Taylor (born June 4, 1960, San Francisco, California), formerly credited as Paul Horowitz, is an American musician, who is best known as the keyboardist/guitarist with the late 1980s and early 1990s rock band, Winger (1987--1992, 2001--2003, 2013--2014). Although he is perhaps most frequently associated with Winger, Taylor has also played with numerous other prominent musicians, including future Sammy Hagar and Boston guitarist Gary Pihl (in his early days), Eric Martin (solo artist and future Mr. Big frontman), Aldo Nova, Steve Perry of Journey, Alice Cooper, and Tommy Shaw.\n\nTaylor experienced his first mainstream success in the early 1980s as the touring keyboardist in Canadian musician Aldo Nova's backing band, and he appears in the music video for Nova's biggest hit, \"Fantasy.\" Prior to forming Winger, Taylor and Kip Winger were both playing with Alice Cooper's backing band on the tours for Cooper's mid-80s albums, \"Constrictor\" (1986) and \"Raise Your Fist and Yell\" (1987). During this time, the two began composing songs together and, while on break from touring, recorded what would become the first Winger demos. Whereas Kip left Alice's band prior to the European leg of the 1987 tour, Paul remained on board for the European dates. However, in the midst of touring Europe, Paul received a call from Kip, who had been working with future Winger lead guitarist Reb Beach recording more demos in New York, informing him that he had gotten a record deal. After the European tour was finished, Paul flew straight back to New York, and the Winger project (initially known as \"Sahara\") began rehearsing and recording their debut album.\n\nTaylor remained in Winger throughout the band's most successful period, which included the two smash albums, \"Winger\" and \"In the Heart of the Young\". However, after the tour supporting the latter album ended in 1991, Taylor left the band in early 1992, citing exhaustion and a desire to write and get involved with other projects. Throughout the 1990s, Taylor immersed himself in numerous other projects, perhaps the most prolific of which was recording and touring with Steve Perry for his 1994 solo album.\n\nIn 1998, he returned to the Alice Cooper band (this time, alongside fellow former Winger guitarist Reb Beach), and once that tour ended, he embarked on a brief tour with Tommy Shaw. Winger reunited in 2001 to record new material for a \"Greatest Hits\" album. Although it is unclear whether Taylor participated in these recording sessions, he did later join the band on the supporting tour. Though Paul was asked by Kip Winger to rejoin the band again to work on their 2006 reunion album, he declined because he was already involved with other projects.\n\nMore recently, Taylor has become involved in composing music for television series programs and has also been pursuing his passion for photography. He also spent the summer months of 2012 touring with Cinderella throughout the U.S. playing keyboards for them. He returned to Winger during mid-2013 and performed with them on select tour dates up through early 2014 and appeared in the Queen Babylon released in late 2014.",

        "wiki_bio_text": "Sir Josiah Mason (23 February 1795 - 16 June 1881) was an English industrialist, engaged in pen manufacture and other trades, and a philanthropist. He founded Mason Science College in 1875, which later became the University of Birmingham. He was the son of a carpet-weaver and was born in Mill Street, Kidderminster. He began life as a street hawker of cakes, fruits, and vegetables. After trying his hand in his native town at shoemaking, baking, carpentry, blacksmithing, house-painting, and carpet-weaving, he moved in 1816 to Birmingham. There he found employment in the gilt-toy trade. In 1824, he set up on his own account as a manufacturer of split-rings by machinery, to which he subsequently added the making of steel pens. Owing to the circumstance of his pens being supplied through James Perry, the London stationer whose name they bore, he was less well known than Joseph Gillott and other makers, although he was really the largest producer in England, contributing heavily to the Birmingham pen trade. In 1874, the business was converted into a limited liability company. Besides his steel-pen trade, Mason carried on for many years the business of electro-plating, copper-smelting, and India-rubber ring making, in conjunction with George Elkington. Mason was almost entirely self-educated, having taught himself to write when a shoemaker's apprentice, and in later life he felt his deficiencies keenly. It was this which led him in 1860 to establish his great orphanage at Erdington, near Birmingham. Upon it he expended about £300,000, and for this munificent endowment he was knighted in 1872. He had previously given a dispensary to his native town and an almshouse to Erdington. In 1880, Mason College, since incorporated in the University of Birmingham, was opened. The total value of the endowment was about £250,000.",

Born on Gulangyu Island, China, he was a child prodigy who later studied at the Juilliard School from 1979. He performed worldwide, including for Queen Beatrix of Belgium, but was tragically lost in a road accident in 2000.",
        "wiki_bio_text": "Fei-Ping Hsu (b. 1952 - d. 2001) was a renowned Chinese American pianist known for his sensitive, brilliant, and poetic interpretations. Mr. Hsu was born on the island of Gulangyu in southeast China. As the youngest son of a Christian pastor, he grew up singing hymns while his mother played on an upright piano. One day, when his mother was ill, the five-year-old Fei-Ping went to the piano and played the hymns by ear. The family realized his tremendous talent and encouraged him to study music. When he was eight years old, he had a rare opportunity to meet Professor Ji-Sen Fan, the head of the piano department of the Shanghai Conservatory, and was recognized as a child prodigy. By the time he was twelve, he already played the complete Chopin Etudes and had performed with the Shanghai Philharmonic.\n\nFeiping was invited to perform for Queen Elisabeth of Belgium, who was so impressed with his ability that she personally invited Fei-Ping to study and perform in Europe under her sponsorship. Unfortunately, he was not allowed to accept this invitation due to the advent of the Cultural Revolution during the 1960s. However, he survived the labor camps and became well known in China, touring extensively throughout the Far East as a soloist with the Central Philharmonic, the foremost leading orchestra. He was a gold medal winner at the Arthur Rubinstein International Piano Competition, the first pianist in the competition's history from the People's Republic of China. He also garnered top prizes in other international competitions, including the Gina Bachauer Memorial Piano Scholarship Competition, the University of Maryland International Competition, and the Paloma O'Shea International Competition (Spain).\n\nMr. Hsu made his New York recital debut at Alice Tully Hall in 1983 and performed throughout the United States, including notable appearances at Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, and the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. He also frequently toured Europe, South America, and the Far East.

His career includes touring with Marvin Gaye in the 1980s and being Henry Mancini's guitarist until 1996. Campbell released over 30 albums, with 18 charting on the US National Jazz Radio Charts. He was inducted into the Indianapolis Jazz Foundation Hall of Fame in 2008.",
        "wiki_bio_text": "Royce Campbell is a jazz guitarist primarily associated with mainstream jazz, but he has also released smooth jazz and post-bop jazz recordings. He was born in Seymour, Indiana, in 1952. The son of a career Navy man, Campbell grew up in various cities around the U.S. and abroad, including Asia, Europe, and the West Indies. Exposure to various musical genres while a child contributed to Campbell's musical style and approach in jazz composition and playing. A love for rock and roll marked Campbell's first connection with the guitar, at the age of nine, when he discovered Chuck Berry. Like many guitarists of his generation, Campbell was also influenced by Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton. By the time Royce finished high school in the early 1970s, he was certain he wanted to pursue a professional career in music. His uncle, Carroll Decamp, an arranger/pianist who arranged for Stan Kenton and Les Elgart, invited Royce to live with him and study in Indiana, providing most of Royce's musical education in theory and composition. By age 21, Campbell had begun touring with R&B artist Marvin Gaye and developing his talents for stage performance. In 1975, Royce was hired by a local music contractor to do three concerts with award-winning film composer Henry Mancini in Indianapolis. Soon after, Royce became the touring guitarist with Henry Mancini's orchestra, holding that position until Mancini's death in 1994. While appearing on recordings as a sideman, and a couple as leader, during the early years of his career, Campbell started recording and touring more on his own during the 1990s, focusing at first on mainstream or straight-ahead jazz. Although he cites Wes Montgomery as his main influence, the influence of horn players such as Dexter Gordon and Chet Baker are evident in Royce's melodic style. In 1993, he produced Project G-5: A Tribute to Wes Montgomery, which also featured guitarists Tal Farlow, Jimmy Raney, Herb Ellis, and Cal Collins. His 1994 album 6x6 featured guitarists Pat Martino, John Abercrombie, Larry Coryell, Dave Stryker, and Bucky Pizzarelli. With Project G-5: A Tribute to Joe Pass, in 1999, he combined the talents of Charlie Byrd, Gene Bertoncini, Mundell Lowe, and John Pisano. During his career, Royce Campbell has released more than 30 CDs as leader or co-leader, among various sideman projects. Fifteen of these CDs have made it onto the US National Jazz Radio Charts. Campbell's soloing is documented among other jazz guitarists of the era, in Mel Bay's Anthology of Jazz Guitar Solos: Featuring Solos by the World's Finest Jazz Guitarists! In November 2010, Royce Campbell was inducted into the Indianapolis Jazz Foundation Hall of Fame.",

His prolific work, drawing on the traditions of the género chico, the zarzuela and the grotesque, came to dominate Spanish comic theatre in the early twentieth century. After starting his career as a novelist and journalist, Arniches turned to theatre in 1888 with the publication of his first play, \"Casa Editorial\". Much of his work is set in lower-class Madrid and uses colloquial language, song, dance and music. Arniches was complimented in a 1935 interview by Federico García Lorca, often a scathing critic of Spanish theatre in the 1920s and 1930s, as \"more of a poet than almost any of those who are writing theatre in verse at the moment\". Following the consolidation of the Franco regime after the Spanish Civil War, the social dramas of Carlos Arniches were among the relatively non-controversial plays allowed by the new government.",

Born in Durban, he excelled in multiple sports. Despite his talent, his cricket career ended after being banned in a 1963 match. Later, he worked in hospitality.",
        "wiki_bio_text": "Geoffrey Merton \"Geoff\" Griffin (12 June 1939 - 16 November 2006) was a cricketer who played two Tests for South Africa in 1960. In his second Test appearance in 1960 at Lord's, he became the first (and, as of November 2014, only) South African cricketer to take a hat-trick in a Test match, and also the first and only cricketer to take a Test hat-trick at Lord's. He is best known for being no-balled for throwing in his second Test and the exhibition match that followed, and he never played Test cricket again.\n\nGriffin was born in Greytown in the former Natal Province and was educated at Durban High School. He was tall and blond, and excelled in many sports, playing hockey for Rhodesia and under-19s rugby for Natal. He was also Natal champion in the high jump, long jump, triple jump and pole vault. Griffin suffered an accident in childhood which rendered him unable to straighten his right arm.\n\nThere was continuing controversy about bowlers \"throwing\" or \"chucking\" the ball (that is, flexing their elbow in the action of bowling the ball, which is contrary to the laws of cricket). The issue had been controversial since the editor of Wisden, Sydney Pardon, claimed that Australian fast bowler Ernest Jones was throwing in the tour of England in 1896, and then Jones and C. B. Fry were both no-balled in the Melbourne Test in 1897. The issue achieved renewed prominence following the Ashes series in Australia in 1958-59, when Australians Ian Meckiff and Gordon Rorke were suspected of throwing. Other fast bowlers, such as West Indies' Charlie Griffith and New Zealand's Gary Bartlett were also suspected. The MCC was determined to stamp out the problem before the Ashes series in England in 1961, and English umpires were instructed to strictly enforce the rule against throwing in 1960.\n\nGriffin made his first-class cricket debut for Natal in the 1957-58 South African domestic season, as a fast bowler. Despite being no-balled in South African provincial matches in the 1959-60 season, Griffin finished at the top of the averages, with 35 wickets at a bowling average of 12.23, and was selected to tour England in 1960, aged 20. Griffin was no-balled 8 times during the tour match against the MCC at Lord's in May 1960, the first time that a touring player was called for throwing, and no-balled again several times by various umpires in matches against the counties. He tried to change his action at Alf Gover's indoor school, and was not called once in the 42 overs that he bowled in the 1st Test at Edgbaston, although his pace was much reduced. In the search for quicker deliveries, he fell back into his old faults, and was called in a tour match against Hampshire. English umpires Frank Lee and Syd Buller repeatedly called Geoff Griffin for throwing in the 2nd Test, at Lord's, starting from his third over.\n\nAfter being no-balled 5 times on the first day and 6 times on the second day, he returned for a final bowling spell on Saturday 25 June and dismissed M. J. K. Smith with the last ball of one over, caught behind by John Waite for 99, and then bowled Peter Walker and Fred Trueman with the first two balls of his next over. This was the first Test cricket hat-trick claimed by a South African cricketer. England immediately declared their first innings for 362 with 8 wickets down. England quickly dismissed South Africa twice to win by an innings and 73 runs, just after lunch on the fourth day, Monday 27 June, with Brian Statham taking 6-62 and 5-34.\n\nA 20-over exhibition match was arranged to fill the period until the scheduled presentation of the players to the Queen at tea. Griffin was again repeatedly no-balled in the exhibition match for throwing, and was also no-balled for failing to notify the umpires that he was changing to bowl underarm to complete an over. Griffin later recounted that Donald Bradman came to the dressing room to console him, and let him know that the umpires were acting on order from MCC President Gubby Allen. Griffin remained on the tour as a batsman, but never played Test cricket again.\n\nMany spectators could see no difference between his \"legitimate\" deliveries, and the ones that were no-balled: many concluded that he threw every delivery. The public saw him as a martyr and scapegoat, and he was warmly applauded by the spectators at all of his subsequent tour matches. None of the controversial Australian bowlers from the 1958-59 Ashes series toured England in 1961. He moved to play for Rhodesia, but his cricket career ended less than 2 years later, at the age of 23, after he was no-balled playing in a Currie Cup match against North Eastern Transvaal at Salisbury.\n\nIn retirement from cricket, he played club cricket, was a cricket coach, and worked as a hotel manager for South African Breweries in Durban, at the Argyll, and then at the Congela Hotel. He married twice. Griffin died of a heart attack in Durban.",

The Kenton trumpet section included Mike Vax, Jay Saunders, and Dennis Noday. Brown also contributed arrangements for Kenton, including \"Mi Burrito\" and \"Neverbird\". Brown remained with the Kenton Orchestra until November 1972. Before joining the Kenton Orchestra, Brown had served as arranger and trumpeter with the studio band of the United States Army Field Band at Fort Meade, Maryland (1968-71). His tenure with the Army Band and Kenton coincided closely with that of Jay Saunders, trumpet player, and jazz educator, who, while with the Kenton Orchestra, eventually played lead trumpet. Brown also has performed with Mundell Lowe, Leroy Vinnegar, Ray Brown (jazz double-bassist), Thad Jones, Jimmy Heath, Steve Gadd, and Billy Hart. Brown conducted the recording session of the Roy Hargrove Quintet entitled \"Roy Hargrove with Strings, Moment to Moment\", released May 2000 on Verve. He has appeared at the Monterey Jazz Festival frequently as conductor of his wife Susan Cahill Brown's Monterey Jazz Festival Chamber Orchestra in collaboration with Charlie Haden, Kenny Barron, Michael Brecker, Ralph Towner, Gary Burton, and Terence Blanchard. Brown currently leads his own big band, the Great Big Band, which has performed at the Monterey Jazz Festival, the San Jose Jazz Festival, the Santa Cruz Jazz Festival, the Lake Tahoe Music Festival, as well as jazz venues in the San Francisco Bay Area. Ray is currently on the faculty of Cabrillo College in Aptos, California, teaching jazz improvisation, arranging, and jazz ensembles.",

He was the head coach of the Clarkson Golden Knights from 2003 to the end of the 2010-11 season, leading them to their most recent conference championship and NCAA tournament appearance. Roll began his coaching career shortly after finishing his college career at Bowling Green, where he was part of the 1984 national championship team, becoming a graduate assistant for his alma mater before joining first-year coach Mark Morris's staff at Clarkson. Roll remained as an assistant for eight years, helping Morris establish Clarkson as a power in ECAC Hockey, winning two regular season titles, two tournament titles, and making the NCAA tournament six times, including a Frozen Four appearance for the first time in over 20 years.\n\nRoll left Clarkson to become the head coach of Oswego State, a Division III program, and in each of his seven years there the Great Lakers finished with a winning record. Unfortunately, other than a tournament appearance in his second season, Oswego State didn't have much else to show for his tenure until 2002-03 when Roll pushed the Great Lakers to a 25-7-1 record, earning a regular season title, a conference championship, and were runners-up to the D-III national title.\n\nRoll, however, decided against building on his earlier success after he was offered the top job at Clarkson, replacing his mentor Mark Morris after he was fired due to an incident in early November. The first few years with the Golden Knights were rocky as Clarkson couldn't manage a winning record until the third year (and even then it was only by one win), but Clarkson won 25 games in 2006-07, including a conference championship, and when they earned a regular season crown the following season it appeared that they had turned the corner.\n\nAfter that brief success, however, Clarkson declined rapidly, ending with losing records in each of the next three seasons and causing Roll's termination at the end of the 2010-11 season. Roll quickly found a new job as he was announced as the first head coach for Nazareth College's new Division-III ice hockey program that was to begin in 2012-13. As of 2014, he is still in that position.",

She is known for her two best-selling novels, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, and for developing a philosophical system she called Objectivism. Born and educated in Russia, Rand moved to the United States in 1926. She had a play produced on Broadway in 1935–1936. After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful in America, she achieved fame with her 1943 novel, The Fountainhead. In 1957, she published her best-known work, the novel Atlas Shrugged. Afterward, she turned to non-fiction to promote her philosophy, publishing her own magazines and releasing several collections of essays until her death in 1982.\n\nRand advocated reason as the only means of acquiring knowledge and rejected faith and religion. She supported rational and ethical egoism, and rejected altruism. In politics, she condemned the initiation of force as immoral and opposed collectivism and statism as well as anarchism, instead supporting \"laissez-faire\" capitalism, which she defined as the system based on recognizing individual rights. In art, Rand promoted romantic realism. She was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her, except for some Aristotelians and classical liberals. Literary critics received Rand's fiction with mixed reviews, and academia generally ignored or rejected her philosophy, though academic interest has increased in recent decades. The Objectivist movement attempts to spread her ideas, both to the public and in academic settings. She has been a significant influence among libertarians and American conservatives.",

The song is a cover version of a track written and previously recorded by Ani DiFranco. \"Blame It on Me\" stayed on the Billboard Top 200 for seven weeks, peaking at #157 in February 1998 and reaching sales of over 240,000 in the United States. \"Murder\", also from \"Blame It on Me\", was sampled on Jay-Z's \"Vol. 3... Life and Times of S. Carter\". After a guest appearance on the 1999 soundtrack to \"The Mod Squad\", Davis left Elektra and signed a single deal with SME Records. She released the single \"Carry On\" on this label, and the song was featured in a Super Bowl commercial for Sony Electronics. Tired of major record labels, Davis went independent in 2005 and formed her own label, Tigress Records. She released a third album, \"Surrender Dorothy\", on this label, which featured the single \"Wide Open\". In 2006, Davis toured with Thievery Corporation for a couple of dates as a guest vocalist.",

Sewall's main claim to fame had been as an exceptionally successful, wealthy shipbuilder and New England industrialist.

Sewall is also one of the few politicians to be an adherent of Swedenborgianism, a religion based on the writings of Swedish theologian Emanuel Swedenborg. His main vice-presidential opponent, Garret A. Hobart (Rep.), was also an Eastern banker and industrialist who had served on his party's national committee. Sewall was Bryan's running mate for the first of Bryan's three times as the Democratic presidential nominee. He died not long after Bryan was nominated for the second time in 1900.

His mother was Louis VI's second wife, Adelaide of Maurienne. The favourite son of his father as a child, Philip was enthroned alongside Louis VI as joint king in 1129. However, the young king gave his father little joy after that, refusing to pay attention to the old king or to follow the high standards that Louis himself followed. He became disobedient, refusing to heed scoldings or warnings; Walter Map said that he \"strayed from the paths of conduct travelled by his father and, by his overweening pride and tyrannical arrogance, made himself a burden to all.\" Philip's brief period as king was ended two years after his coronation. Riding with a group of companions along the Seine, in the Parisian market section named the Greve, his running horse was tripped by a black pig which darted out of a dung heap on the quay. The horse fell forwards, and the young king was catapulted over its head. The fall \"so dreadfully fractured his limbs that he died on the day following\" without regaining consciousness. He was buried at St Denis, and succeeded as heir, and co-king, by his pious brother, Louis the Younger (now known as Louis VII).\n\nIf Philip had been little other than trouble and a problem to his family and kingdom whilst he had lived, his legacy would prove greater trouble still. Whilst he had lived, he had nurtured a dream of visiting Jerusalem and the tomb of Christ; when he died, his brother, Louis VII, vowed to go in Philip's place. This vow would provide a reason for Louis joining the disastrous Second Crusade and an excuse to abandon Antioch in favour of Jerusalem. The Crusade brought many deaths on both sides, and the abandonment of Antioch proved a strategic failure and a partial cause for the collapse of the marriage between Louis and his wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine. Because he was co-king rather than a king in his own right, he is not generally given a number in the succession of Kings of France.",

He began working in the railroad business as a clerk at the age of 17 and quickly rose through the ranks of management to become the general manager of the Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific Railway. He became vice-president of that company in 1889 and remained as such until 1896 when he became general manager of the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) of Canada. Hays left GTR for a short time to serve as the president of the Southern Pacific Railway Company but returned to GTR after one year.

He became a character actor and supporting player in at least eighty-eight films between 1931 and 1944. Earlier, he appeared in more than twenty Broadway plays. He left school to appear on stage with a repertory company and had no screen experience when he signed a contract with Fox in May 1931. Dinehart's likeness was drawn in caricature by Alex Gard for Sardi's, the New York City theater district restaurant. The picture is now part of the collection of the New York Public Library. Dinehart's first wife was the stage actress Louise Dyer (1895-1934), a native of Nassau County, New York. They were divorced in 1932. In 1933, Dinehart married the film actress Mozelle Britton (May 12, 1912 - May 18, 1953), a native of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. They are entombed together at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. Dinehart had two sons: from the first marriage, Alan Dinehart Jr. (1918-1992), and from the second marriage, Mason Alan Dinehart, aka Alan Dinehart III, born in Los Angeles in 1936. Mason Alan Dinehart was cast in several 1950s television series, including the role of a young Bat Masterson in the ABC/Desilu Studios western, \"The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp\", starring Hugh O'Brian in the title role.",

        "wiki_bio_text": "Lester Halbert Germer (October 10, 1896 - October 3, 1971) was an American physicist. Along with Clinton Davisson, he proved the wave-particle duality of matter in the Davisson-Germer experiment, which was important to the development of the electron microscope. These studies supported the theoretical work of de Broglie. He also studied thermionics, erosion of metals, and contact physics. He was awarded the Elliott Cresson Medal in 1931. A former fighter pilot in World War I, Germer subsequently worked at Bell Labs in New Jersey. In 1945 (at the age of 49), Germer launched a side career as a rock climber. He climbed widely around the Northeast United States, and especially at New York's Shawangunk Ridge. Although the Appalachian Mountain Club was dominant in the area at the time, and strictly regulated rock climbing, Lester was never associated with the club, and found himself in conflict with the leading climber in the area, Hans Kraus, who was head of the AMC's safety committee. He was once turned down for climbing certification with the comment \"likes people too much and is too enthusiastic.\" Lester was known for being generous and friendly. He was once called \"a one man climbing school.\" In 1971, one week before his 75th birthday, Lester Germer died of a massive heart attack while lead climbing a rock climb at the Shawangunk Ridge (\"Eyebrow\", 5.6). Until that moment, Lester had a twenty-six year perfect safety record in rock climbing; he had never even taken a leader fall.",

        "wiki_bio_text": "George Hubbard Clapp (1858-1949) was an American pioneer in the aluminum industry and a numismatist. He was born on December 14 in Allegheny City, Pennsylvania (now a part of Pittsburgh), the son of Delia Dennig Hubbard and Dewitt Clinton Clapp, an iron company executive. He graduated from the Western University of Pennsylvania (today's University of Pittsburgh) in 1877. He married Anne Love in 1882 and the couple had two children. Clapp took an engineering position at Park Brothers' Black Diamond Steel Works. There, along with Captain Alfred E. Hunt, he established the Pittsburgh Testing Laboratory's chemistry department. Hunt formed a company in 1888 to exploit the Charles Martin Hall patents for making aluminum by electrolysis. Clapp was treasurer and secretary of the fledgling company. He resigned as treasurer in 1892 and was replaced by Andrew W. Mellon. The company later became known as the Aluminium Company of America. While Hall is generally credited with the invention of the aluminum process, Clapp raised the initial venture capital to make the process commercially viable; the Mellon interests supplied the company's working capital.\n\nAs Clapp's wealth grew, he pursued his avocational interests in conchology and numismatics. He had begun collecting coins as a boy in the 1870s by sifting through the coins of a toll bridge across the Allegheny River. He later became a founder of the Western Pennsylvania Numismatic Society. His grandfather encouraged him to start collecting shells; over the years he assembled more than 100,000 mollusk shells, which he later donated to the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh. In the 1930s he donated his coin collections to both the American Numismatic Society and the Carnegie.\n\nBeginning in 1907 until his death, Clapp was president of Pitt's Board of Trustees. He was a driving force in moving the school from its North Side location to the Oakland district. He also was a trustee of the Carnegie Institute of Technology (today's Carnegie Mellon University) and a member of the American Chemical Society. He died at age 90 on March 31, 1949 at his home in Sewickley, Pennsylvania. Clapp Hall, an academic building on the Pitt campus, is named in his honor.",

I had a .45 in a shoulder holster, but he couldn't reach that.

Foster continued: \"I could see that he was like one of our officers if he'd been picked up. I questioned all that we knew about these vicious people.\" Göring was convicted of war crimes and committed suicide in October 1946 by taking a cyanide capsule before he could be hanged by the Nuremberg authorities.\n\nBy October 1945, Foster was back in the United States, having flown seventy reconnaissance combat missions during his wartime service.

He entered the Imperial Navy in 1934 and completed pilot training in December 1936. His first combat occurred over China in early 1938, and he emerged as the top naval ace of the campaign, credited with 14 aerial victories. Subsequently, he flew Zeros from the aircraft carrier Zuikaku from December 1941 to May 1942, including at the Battle of the Coral Sea. In late 1943, Iwamoto's air group was sent to Rabaul, New Britain, resulting in three months of the hardest air combat ever undertaken by the IJNAF against air raids mounted by U.S. and Allied air units. Subsequent assignments were Truk Atoll in the Carolines and the Philippines, and he was commissioned an Ensign in October 1944. Following the evacuation of the Philippines, Iwamoto served in home defense and trained Kamikaze pilots. Like many Japanese veterans, Iwamoto was reported to have fallen into depression after the war. His diary was found after his death, with claims of 202 Allied aircraft destroyed. As a result of the Japanese use of the British naval practices, the IJNAF scoring system was based on the system the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force (RAF) adopted from World War I until World War II. This system differed from the scoring system used by the U.S. Navy Air Force and U.S. Marine Air Force during World War II. Dr. Izawa and Professor Hata estimated the figure at about 80 or more than 87 in their research work in January 1971. In December 1993, Izawa wrote that Iwamoto was \"virtually\" the top ace of the IJNAF. As of mid-1944, there remained only two IJNAF fighter pilots who were credited with over 100 victories. Depending on various totals cited, Tetsuzō Iwamoto or Hiroyoshi Nishizawa was Japan's best ace. Iwamoto was known as the Chūtai leader (flying company, squadron of 8 to 16 fighters). Iwamoto was one of few survivors of the IJNAF from the early part of the Second World War.

Born in Uigg, Prince Edward Island, the son of William and Catherine Nicholson Mackinnon, Mackinnon attended Uigg Grammar School and started teaching when he was 14. He later received a first-class teaching licence from the Prince of Wales College in Charlottetown. In 1882, he started articling with the Charlottetown barrister Malcolm McLeod. From 1885 to 1887, he attended Dalhousie Law School where he received a Bachelor of Laws degree. He was called to the bar as an attorney in 1887 and a barrister in 1888. He was created a Queen's Counsel in 1899. He opened a practice in Georgetown, Prince Edward Island in 1887 where he remained until moving to Charlottetown in 1897. In 1900, he became President of the Law Society of Prince Edward Island. From 1893 to 1900, he was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island for the electoral district of 4th Kings.

        "wiki_bio_text": "Heinz Christian Pander (24 July 1794 – 22 September 1865), also known as Christian Heinrich Pander, was a Baltic German biologist and embryologist born in Riga. In 1817, he received his doctorate from the University of Würzburg, and spent several years (1827–1842) performing scientific research from his estate in Carnikava (on the banks of the Gauja River near Riga). In 1820, he took part in a scientific expedition to Bokhara as a naturalist. In 1826, he became a member of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Pander studied the chick embryo and discovered the germ layers (i.e., three distinct regions of the embryo that give rise to the specific organ system). Because of these findings, he is considered by many to be the \"founder of embryology\". His work in embryology was continued by Karl Ernst von Baer (1792–1876), who expanded Pander's concept of germ layers to include all vertebrates. Pander performed important studies in the field of paleontology, being known for his extensive research on fossils found in the Devonian and Silurian geological strata of the Baltic regions. His study of trilobites from this age led to the adjective \"Panderian\", first used by the Canadian palaeontologist Elkanah Billings. Pander is credited as the first scientist to describe primitive creatures known as conodonts. Today, the Pander Society is an international association of palaeontologists and stratigraphers with a common interest in the study of conodonts. He died in Saint Petersburg.",

A 6'6\" power forward/center, he played professionally in the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1956 to 1966. While attending San Pedro High School in San Pedro, California, he was named California Mr. Basketball in 1952. After becoming an All-American playing at UCLA, Naulls was drafted by the St. Louis Hawks in 1956. He spent just 19 games with the Hawks, however, before being traded to the New York Knicks, with whom he would spend the prime of his career. He averaged a double-double (19.3 points per game, 10.7 rebounds per game) during his seven-year tenure with the team, and he appeared as an NBA All-Star four times. While with the Knicks, Naulls was also the first African-American player to be named captain of a major professional sports team. During the 1962-63 NBA season, the Knicks traded Naulls to the San Francisco Warriors, who then traded Naulls to the Boston Celtics. Naulls would spend his last three professional seasons with the Celtics, winning three NBA championship rings in the process. He was a member of the 1964-1965 Celtics team that was named one of the ten best teams in the NBA at the 50th anniversary of the association. Upon retiring in 1966, he had tallied 11,305 career points and 6,508 career rebounds. On February 24, 2005, Naulls, Campy Russell, and Kenny Walker were honored by the Knicks during their \"Hardwood Classics Night.\"",

        "wiki_bio_text": "George John Kurowski (April 19, 1918 – December 9, 1999) was a third baseman in Major League Baseball who played his entire career for the St. Louis Cardinals (1949). Kurowski batted and threw right-handed. He debuted on September 23, 1941, and played his final game on October 1, 1949. In a nine-season career, Kurowski posted a .286 batting average with 106 home runs and 529 RBI in 916 games played. Kurowski's childhood nickname came from his already white hair. A native of Reading, Pennsylvania, Kurowski overcame several personal problems. He overcame childhood osteomyelitis, which made him miss a part of a bone on his right forearm. Before he started his baseball career, his older brother died in a mine accident, and his father died from a heart attack during spring training in 1942. His most productive season came in 1945, when he posted career-highs in average (.310), home runs (27), RBI (104), runs (108), doubles (27), slugging percentage (.544) and on-base percentage (.420). An All-Star during five consecutive seasons (1943–47), Kurowski exceeded the 20 home run mark three times to set a major league record for a third baseman (1944–45, 1947), and hit over .300 three times (1945–47). He also led the National League three times in putouts, twice in fielding percentage, and once in double plays. In four World Series appearances, Kurowski hit .253 (21-for-83) with one home run and nine RBI in 23 games, as the Cardinals were world champions in 1942, 1944 and 1946. His only home run in the series, in 1942, off Red Ruffing, broke a 2–2 tie in the ninth inning of Game Five to clinch the title for St. Louis over the New York Yankees. He also appeared five times in the MVP ballot, in 1942 and from 1944 through 1947. In 1949, Kurowski developed arm and elbow problems and his playing career ended. After that, he coached and managed in the minor leagues for 18 years until 1972. He gained induction into the National Polish-American Hall of Fame in 1988. In an article in 1976 in Esquire magazine, sportswriter Harry Stein published an \"All-Time All-Star Argument Starter,\" consisting of five ethnic baseball teams. Kurowski was the third baseman on Stein's Polish team. Kurowski died in Sinking Spring, Pennsylvania, at age 81.",

            "In a nine-season career, Kurowski posted a .286 batting average with 106 home runs and 529 RBI in 916 games played. Kurowski's childhood nickname came from his already white hair. A native of Reading, Pennsylvania, Kurowski overcame several personal problems.",
            "He overcame childhood osteomyelitis, which made him miss a part of a bone on his right forearm. Before he started his baseball career, his older brother died in a mine accident, and his father died from a heart attack during spring training in 1942.",
            "His most productive season came in 1945, when he posted career-highs in average (.310), home runs (27), RBI (104), runs (108), doubles (27), slugging percentage (.544) and on-base percentage (.420).",
            "An All-Star during five consecutive seasons (1943–47), Kurowski exceeded the 20 home run mark three times to set a major league record for a third baseman (1944–45, 1947), and hit over .300 three times (1945–47).",
            "He also led the National League three times in putouts, twice in fielding percentage, and once in double plays. In four World Series appearances, Kurowski hit .253 (21-for-83) with one home run and nine RBI in 23 games, as the Cardinals were world champions in 1942, 1944 and 1946.",
            "His only home run in the series, in 1942, off Red Ruffing, broke a 2–2 tie in the ninth inning of Game Five to clinch the title for St. Louis over the New York Yankees. He also appeared five times in the MVP ballot, in 1942 and from 1944 through 1947.",
            "In 1949, Kurowski developed arm and elbow problems and his playing career ended. After that, he coached and managed in the minor leagues for 18 years until 1972. He gained induction into the National Polish-American Hall of Fame in 1988.",
            "In an article in 1976 in Esquire magazine, sportswriter Harry Stein published an \"All-Time All-Star Argument Starter,\" consisting of five ethnic baseball teams. Kurowski was the third baseman on Stein's Polish team. Kurowski died in Sinking Spring, Pennsylvania, at age 81."

He played for the UCLA Bruins and in the National Basketball Association. He attended Corona del Mar High School, where he was a guard turned forward. He was selected to the All California Interscholastic Federation team and twice captured All Irvine League honors. As a 6'2\" forward for Orange Coast College, Vallely averaged 26 points per game and broke 18 scoring records. He was selected a Junior College All American. He dribbled with his left hand and shot with his right hand, and was especially good at shooting an outside jump shot.\n\nVallely was an integral member of the Bruins' backcourt after transferring from Orange Coast College in 1968. He was quick to make the transition from forward to guard at UCLA. In his first season, he was the Bruins' third leading scorer (12.9 p.p.g.) and adapted smoothly to head coach John Wooden's \"attack and gamble offense\". He was a member of the UCLA teams that won national titles in the 1969 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament and the 1970 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. Vallely majored in economics at UCLA and had a 3.36 grade point average as a junior. He was selected to the twelve-man 1968 Olympic trials team coached by Jerry Tarkanian which competed in Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\nHe was taken by the Atlanta Hawks in the first round of the 1970 NBA Draft. He sat on the bench much of the time, playing behind Pete Maravich, Lou Hudson, Walt Hazzard, and Herm Gilliam. Vallely was acquired by the Houston Rockets in November 1971 along with 6'7\" forward Jim Davis.",

Grabau. Grabau was born in Olvenstedt, Prussia (now a part of Greater Magdeburg, Germany). He was the son of Johann Andreas Grabau and Anna Dorothea Jericho. Grabau was educated at the grammar school in Olvenstedt (1809 - 1818), the Magdeburg Gymnasium (1818 - 1825), and at the University of Halle (1825 - 1829). After three years as a teacher in Magdeburg and Sachsa bei Nordhausen, Grabau was ordained and installed as pastor of St. Andrew's Church in Erfurt in June 1834. Grabau was jailed twice for refusing to use the Prussian Union agenda and was permitted to immigrate to America in summer 1839 with members of Lutheran congregations in Erfurt and Magdeburg. They settled in Buffalo, New York, where he served as pastor of a Lutheran congregation for 40 years. On July 15, 1845, along with four pastors, Grabau founded \"The Synod of the Lutheran Church Emigrated from Prussia\" (German: \"Synode der aus Preussen ausgewanderten lutherischen Kirche\"), which became known as \"The Buffalo Synod\". Grabau also founded the Martin Luther College in Buffalo. Grabau retained control of the Martin Luther College and remained as its rector. The official organ of Grabau's synod after 1866 was \"Die Wachende Kirche\", under his editorship. Grabau was married on July 15, 1834, to Christine Sophia Burgraf, the daughter of Johann Andreas Burggraf and Friedericke Louise Elizabeth Beulke.

        "wiki_bio_text": "Laurier Lévesque (October 13, 1929 - September 2005) was a Canadian educator and politician in the province of New Brunswick. A graduate of St. Joseph's College in Memramcook and the New Brunswick Teachers' College in Fredericton, Lévesque taught school before entering political life. A resident of Edmundston, New Brunswick, he was first elected to the Legislative Assembly in the 1960 New Brunswick general election as a Liberal Party candidate for one of the three seats for Madawaska County. He was reelected in 1963, 1967, and 1970. In the 1974 election, he lost by 95 votes to the Progressive Conservative candidate Jean-Pierre Ouellet in the newly created riding of Madawaska-les-Lacs. Without the Parti Acadien contesting the riding, Lévesque may have won; the Parti Acadien received 99 votes, ones that are generally accepted as being traditional Liberal supporters. Lévesque attempted a political comeback in the City of Edmundston riding in 1982 but lost to Jean-Maurice Simard.\n\nAs a member of the Legislative Assembly in the government of Premier Louis Robichaud, Lévesque was an ardent defender of Francophone rights and was one of the first members to give his speeches in the Assembly in the French language. Out of politics, in 1990 the Government of Canada appointed him to diplomatic missions abroad which organized and supervised democratic elections in 10 African countries, in two countries from the former Soviet Union, as well as in Bosnia and Herzegovina.",

        "wiki_bio_text": "Baba Gündüz Kılıç (1918-1980) was a Turkish football player and coach. He was the son of Ali Kılıç and the brother of Altemur Kılıç. Born in 1918 in Istanbul, Gündüz Kılıç attended Galatasaray Lycee and then started his football career as a center forward with Galatasaray SK. He was strong, big, well-educated, sophisticated, charismatic, charming, and hungry for success. He never looked flashy, yet was never boring. Kılıç was the mastermind behind the rise of Turkish football, schooling football players that would become respectable managers after their career. He took a break from his career in 1938, moving to Germany for a university education. When he returned to Turkey, he again wore the Galatasaray shirt and won two league championships with the team. Kılıç, who played 11 matches with the Turkey national football team, played for Galatasaray until 1953, except for when he played for Ankara Demirspor during his national service military obligation. His five goals against Beşiktaş JK are still a record for all three Istanbulian derbies. His five goals were scored in the 43rd (1-1), 58th (4-1), 73rd (5-2), 76th (6-2), and 89th (9-2).\n\nThe \"Gündüz Kılıç Revolution\" started early one morning at Galatasaray in 1952, when he hung his uniform in his locker and put on his coaching suit and whistle without looking back. Once the captain of the Galatasaray team, Gündüz Kılıç coached his former teammates and the bright young talents he added to the squad. He led his team to several championships after eighteen years without a championship between 1934 and 1952. He also transferred Turkish superstar Metin Oktay to the team. Under Kılıç, Galatasaray reached the quarter-finals of the European Cup, with the AC Milan side of Nereo Rocco ending their run. Every Galatasaray player, student, or supporter had found an exemplary man in Gündüz Kılıç: a man who performed so well, motivated so well, educated so well, and brought out the very best in every single person he ever worked with. A true gentleman both on and off the field, Gündüz Kılıç helped Galatasaray to reach new targets. Under his leadership, Galatasaray won numerous championships, Turkish Cup titles, and international matches. His visionary coaching style and strong communication skills were to be the backbone of Turkish coaching for many years to come.\n\nThe player, whose nickname was \"Father\", died in New York City, USA on 17 May 1980. His body was transferred to Istanbul and was interred at the Aşiyan Asri Cemetery.",
