        "doc": "(CNN)Soon, America will be too fat to fight. Forget about rampant diabetes, heart attacks and joint problems -- the scariest consequence arising out of our losing battle with the bulge is the safety of our country. In about five years, so many young Americans will be grossly overweight that the military will be unable to recruit enough qualified soldiers. That alarming forecast comes from Maj, Gen. Allen Batschelet, who is in charge of U.S. Army Recruiting Command. Obesity, he told me, \"is becoming a national security issue.\" I was so taken aback by Batschelet's statement that I felt the need to press him. Come on! Obesity? A national security crisis? The General didn't blink. \"In my view, yes.\" Of the 195,000 young men and women who signed up to fight for our country, only 72,000 qualified. Some didn't make the cut because they had a criminal background, or a lack of education, or too many tattoos. But a full 10% didn't qualify because they were overweight. Before you accuse me of sensationalizing, it's that 10% figure that worries General Batschelet the most. \"The obesity issue is the most troubling because the trend is going in the wrong direction,\" he said. \"We think by 2020 it could be as high as 50%, which mean only 2 in 10 would qualify to join the Army.\" He paused. \"It's a sad testament to who we are as a society right now.\" The problem is so worrisome for the Army that recruiters have become fitness coaches, like the trainers on the NBC show, \"The Biggest Loser.\" Yes, your tax dollars pay for Army recruiters to play Dolvett Quince or Jillian Michaels to whip could-be recruits into shape with the hope they can diet and exercise their way to become real recruits. If they lose enough weight, they're sent to boot camp. Some make it; many don't. But, General Batschelet told me the Army must try. \"We are the premier leader on personal development in the world,\" he told me. \"We want to see you grow and become a leader. That is a great strength in our Army.\" Except the Army never considered the type of growth it's now contending with. Nowadays \"personal development\" means working on both character and ... girth. The general, along with so many others in this country, is struggling with why so many Americans, despite all the warnings, continue to eat too much and exercise too little. I have a theory. It ain't pretty. But it's got to be true: We just don't care. \"The acceptance of obesity is prevalent,\" according to Claire Putnam, an obstetrician and gynecologist who believes obesity is a national crisis right now. \"When you look around you, 70% of adults are overweight or obese. It's seems normal,\" she said. Just look at the numbers: More than one-third of U.S. adults are obese. Seventeen percent of all children and adolescents in the U.S. are obese. That's triple the rate from just a generation ago. So, maybe we should face the fact that we've grown comfortable with our girth. It is crystal clear we haven't the foggiest idea of who needs to lose weight and who doesn't. Just the other day, Twitter trolls scolded the singer, Pink, for gaining weight. Pink is not remotely fat. Neither is Selena Gomez, haters. Or Britney Spears, hecklers. If 70% of us are overweight in this country, why are there so many willing to fat-shame people who are not remotely obese? Maybe it's easier to criticize others for carrying extra weight than to admit we have a weight problem ourselves. Because it is abundantly clear we are wallowing in denial. Dr. Putnam points to one of Kaiser Permanante's medical questionnaires. You know, the paperwork patients are asked to fill out before they see the doctor. There is actually a box on the form that allows the patient to \"opt out of talking about obesity.\" Some patients refuse to step on the scale. \"You want to be sensitive to that patient,\" Putnam told me. \"You don't want to nag. But, doctors need to step in and say we need to fix this.\" CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, agrees with Putnam. \"Perceptions of weight are a big part of the problem,\" he said to me. \"If a person is overweight -- as difficult as it is -- they ought to be told. You know, this issue reminds me of the issue with concussions. We should call them what they really are: a brain injury, not 'getting your bell rung.' In the same vein, we should tell people who are overweight or obese that, clinically, they're 'overweight' or 'obese' and at risk for just about every chronic disease in the book.\" In other words, chubby is not the proper way to describe a person who is obese. Just like \"fat\" is not the proper term for Pink or Selena Gomez. And, yes, semantics matter. According to the CDC, 81% of overweight boys and 71% of overweight girls believe they are just the right weight. We've clearly lost our perspective on what's normal when it comes to a healthy weight. So much so it's becoming a national security problem. So what will it take? The answer cannot be the U.S Army.",

            "(CNN)Soon, America will be too fat to fight. Forget about rampant diabetes, heart attacks and joint problems -- the scariest consequence arising out of our losing battle with the bulge is the safety of our country. In about five years, so many young Americans will be grossly overweight that the military will be unable to recruit enough qualified soldiers. That alarming forecast comes from Maj, Gen. Allen Batschelet, who is in charge of U.S. Army Recruiting Command. Obesity, he told me, \"is",

Obesity, he told me, \"is becoming a national security issue.\" I was so taken aback by Batschelet's statement that I felt the need to press him. Come on! Obesity? A national security crisis?

Before you accuse me of sensationalizing, it's that 10% figure that worries General Batschelet the most. \"The obesity issue is the most troubling because the trend is going in the wrong direction,\" he said. \"We think by 2020 it could be as high as 50%, which mean only 2 in 10 would qualify to join the Army.\" He paused. \"It's a",

But, General Batschelet told me the Army must try. \"We are the premier leader on personal development in the world,\" he told me. \"We want to see you grow and become a leader. That is a great strength in our Army.\" Except the Army never considered the type of growth it's now contending with. Nowadays \"personal development\" means",

The general, along with so many others in this country, is struggling with why so many Americans, despite all the warnings, continue to eat too much and exercise too little. I have a theory.

            "acceptance of obesity is prevalent,\" according to Claire Putnam, an obstetrician and gynecologist who believes obesity is a national crisis right now. \"When you look around you, 70% of adults are overweight or obese. It's seems normal,\" she said. Just look at the numbers: More than one-third of U.S. adults are obese. Seventeen percent of all children and adolescents in the U.S. are obese.

It is crystal clear we haven't the foggiest idea of who needs to lose weight and who doesn't. Just the other day, Twitter trolls scolded the singer, Pink, for gaining weight.

There is actually a box on the form that allows the patient to \"opt out of talking about obesity.\" Some patients refuse to step on the scale. \"You want to be sensitive to that patient,\" Putnam told me. \"You don't want to nag. But, doctors need to step in and say we need to fix this.\" CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, agrees with Putnam. \"Perceptions of weight are a big part of the problem,\" he said to me. \"If a person is",

You know, this issue reminds me of the issue with concussions. We should call them what they really are: a brain injury, not 'getting your bell rung.'

Just like \"fat\" is not the proper term for Pink or Selena Gomez. And, yes, semantics matter. According to the CDC, 81% of overweight boys and 71% of overweight girls believe they are just the right weight. We've clearly lost our perspective on what's normal when it comes to a healthy weight.

Packages containing heroin and cannabis were cleared from the roof of HMP Altcourse in Liverpool - hurled there from the outside by friends of inmates who missed their intended targets.

        "doc": "A bruising training session involving 50 scrums is how Tom Wood’s Northampton prepared for Saturday’s top-of-the-table meeting with Saracens. The Champions have creaked in recent weeks and England flanker Wood, who claims Saints’ opponents have ‘smelt blood’, is desperate to re-gather the momentum that was lost following the exodus of key international players during the RBS 6 Nations. Defeats by Clermont and Exeter have done little to restore confidence but the East Midlands side are ready to address their mini-slump and breathe life back into the title push. Northampton flanker Tom Wood is keen for his side to regain their form following some recent poor results The Saints were dumped out of the Champions Cup quarter-finals as Clermont ran riot on their home turf ‘I don’t think anyone intentionally switches off, but the intensity of a Six Nations camp like that is very difficult to manage,’ said Wood. ‘Some people think you’re away at a five-star holiday resort but the pressure is real. It’s a couple of per cent across the board. ‘You might win it and be partying or you might have lost and come back with a lack of confidence. Then the guys who have stayed back in the trenches for Saints feel like the cavalry have arrived. In fact, the guys coming back are equally tired or even more so. It’s a combination of things and it’s difficult to manage. ‘Now there’s light at the end of the tunnel and we’re not far off full strength. It’s the home straight.’ Saturday’s showpiece fixture will be staged at stadiummk, rather than Franklin’s Gardens, and a record attendance is expected at the home of MK Dons. Northampton’s scrummaging pride was dented in the defeat by Exeter and, according to Wood, the players have paid the price with gruelling fitness sessions. ‘We’ve had to speak a few hard truths and take a good look at ourselves,’ said Wood. ‘Teams have smelt blood a little bit. The last couple of teams have really got into us and pressured us at the scrum, which is something we pride ourselves on. ‘When you give them an in, the fear factor goes all of a sudden and the reputation can dwindle quickly. We’ve got to plug that hole if we really want to be title challengers. You don’t win a Premiership without a strong scrum and set piece. Jim Mallinder's side have been boosted by the return of England lock Courtney Lawes ‘We’ve definitely been knocked off our rhythm but I don’t think we’ve played well for a long time. Winning can paper over a lot of problems and mask a lot of issues.’ But Saints’ season is still very much alive. They will almost guarantee a home play-off with victory while, in contrast, Harlequins campaign will be over if they lose to Sale. The west London club also felt the squeeze of the Six Nations and they must win at the AJ Bell Stadium to keep alive their slim hopes of Champions Cup qualification. Harlequins full back Ugo Monye (centre) is hanging up his boots at the end of the season For winger Ugo Monye, who lines up against Mark Cueto this afternoon as both players prepare to hang up their boots, it is the last chance to leave his childhood club with European rugby. ‘I’m not going to be here next season but I want to finish in the best possible way,’ said Monye. ‘It’s hard to get your head around 14 years coming to an end, because I’ve been here since I finished school and it’s all I’ve known. I might be locking horns with Mark Cueto, who’s also retiring, this weekend and it will be just as competitive as the first time I faced him.’ GLOUCESTER v NEWCASTLE (SATURDAY: Kingsholm, 3pm) Dan Robson and Billy Burns form a new half-back pairing for the hosts, in a reshuffled side led by Billy Twelvetrees. Will Welch and Ally Hogg return to the Newcastle back row after injury breaks. PREDICTION: Home win. LEICESTER V LONDON WELSH (SATURDAY: Welford Road, 3pm) England lock contender Graham Kitchener makes a first Tigers appearance since February, alongside Brad Thorn. Olly Barkley reclaims the Exiles’ No 10 shirt and ex-Leicester flanker Ben Pienaar also starts. PREDICTION: Home win. NORTHAMPTON V SARACENS (SATURDAY: Stadium MK, 3.15pm) Courtney Lawes has been passed fit to return for Saints, while prop Salesi Ma’afu comes in to reinforce the pack. Schalk Brits lines up at hooker for Saracens, but Owen Farrell and Chris Ashton are on the bench. PREDICTION: Home win. SALE v HARLEQUINS (SATURDAY: AJ Bell Stadium, 2pm) The Sharks have shifted Josh Beaumont into the second row, to allow TJ Ioane to start at No 8. Quins are still without England full back Mike Brown and have brought in George Lowe at outside centre. PREDICTION: Home win. WASPS v EXETER (SUNDAY: Ricoh Arena, 2pm) Nathan Hughes will wear No 8 for Wasps after having a suspension overturned, while Christian Wade is fit to start. Phil Dollman is out with a leg injury, so Byron McGuigan takes over at full back for Exeter. PREDICTION: Home win.",

        "doc": "John Carver has hit back at former Newcastle captain Michael Owen after he said they would lose every remaining match this season. The pundit has claimed his old club would be relegated if there were 10 games left to play instead of just five. The Magpies will set a new club record of seven straight Premier League defeats should they be beaten at home by Swansea. Newcastle manager John Carver is not happy with recent criticism aimed at his struggling side Carver has been left with a sour taste in his mouth following Michael Owen's recent relegation jibe Michael Owen captained the Newcastle side which was relegated to the Championship in 2009 Newcastle are seven points off the relegation zone Owen has been joined by the likes of Phil Neville and Sportsmail’s Jamie Carragher in criticising both the team and the lack of ambition at the club, whose supporters will again protest against owner Mike Ashley. But Carver says he does not listen to those who have never tried management, including Owen, who was relegated with Newcastle in 2009. ‘I could be nasty about Michael because let’s not forget what happened when he was here,’ said Carver. ‘But listen, I don’t have a problem with anyone having an opinion. Where I have the problem is with people who have never been in this situation - never been in my situation now. ‘They have never had to sit here and pick a team when you have got so many injuries, suspensions, or dealing with situations on the training ground or something from left field that you think, \"Where’s that come from?”.’ He added: ‘Let’s not start a war here because I accept that the likes of Michael Owen and Jamie Carragher have played hundreds of Premier League football matches and I haven’t. I understand that. ‘But sometimes there has to be a little bit of sympathy with the people doing this job. When you have never gone in and put your foot in the water and tested it, then it is a little different. ‘There are a lot of people out there who don’t do it because they can’t do it. ‘It’s easy talking with a tactics board and dobbers, but all of a sudden in this position you have to make a decision because your back four is not high enough and someone is causing you problems because of it. If you don’t see that during a game then you have a problem. People don’t see that.’ Carver, though, does have time for the likes of Graeme Souness and Peter Reid, the former managers of Newcastle and Sunderland respectively. ‘I never listened to Graeme when I was academy director here but what I will say is that he talks an awful lot of sense on the TV,’ said United’s head coach. ‘And when I see someone like Peter Reid on TV, who has been in this situation and has managed in this region, he understands what it feels like. I respect what he says.’ Newcastle ace Siem de Jong will be included on the substitutes' bench for his side's match against Swansea Meanwhile, Newcastle will include Siem de Jong on the bench for the first time since August.

Then there is the inevitable speculation over the future of under-fire manager Manuel Pellegrini. But the biggest challenge for Manchester City this summer could be keeping hold of something they already have. Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero looks on dejected during the defeat by United at Old Trafford The afternoon started so well for Aguero and City when he opened the scoring after just eight minutes Aguero celebrates his 99th goal for Manchester City with David Silva as De Gea looks dejected It may have gone largely unnoticed in the carnage at Old Trafford but there was an important landmark for the brilliant Sergio Aguero that deserves to be recognised. The aftermath of a crushing derby defeat at the old enemy may not be the place for jelly and ice-cream but the Argentine's tremendous feat of scoring 100 goals in just 158 appearances should be cause for celebration. Take a minute to think where City would have been without that century. Remember THAT title-winning goal against QPR in 2012? Most, in that situation, would have put their foot through the ball as soon as it arrived from Mario Balotelli. Not Kun. The man who takes his nickname from a cartoon character had City fans believing in fairy tales when he feigned a shot to open up space before firing home probably the biggest goal in the club's long history. That calm head, that powerful shot and that unnerving ability to find the target are what City paid what now looks like a bargain £38m for in 2011. Aguero netted his 100th goal for City in the 89th minute but there was no cause for celebration The Argentine strikes in injury time against QPR to win Manchester City the title in 2012 Aguero celebrates with Edin Dzeko after that goal when City scored twice in injury time to win title Aguero is settled in Manchester and signed a new five-year deal only last August. However, he now has to think of himself. If the unthinkable happens and City slip outside the top four will one of the best players in the world be happy at a season without showcasing his talents on the Champions League stage? There are admirers. Real Madrid and Barcelona are both fans. Should either register an interest City would face a desperate battle to keep hold of their star man. While a move to Madrid may come with an enticing caveat in the shape of Gareth Bale, the loss of Aguero would be exceptionally difficult to recover from. Where else do you get those goals from? While it is too early in his City career to pass judgement it would appear that the burden would be too much for Wilfried Bony's broad shoulders. Wilfried Bony has only scored once in five appearances since joining City from Swansea in January City's ageing squad is in need of a major overhaul in the summer Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba is a potential target as the City owner prepares to open the cheque book The former Swansea City man, who cost just £10m less than Aguero, has failed to hit the ground running since his January move and has scored only once in five appearances. The powers-that-be would no doubt have to open their chequebook but who would come to an Aguero-less City? And, should they sleepwalk out of the top four, who would dream of coming to a club without Champions League football? The likes of Paul Pogba and Raheem Sterling are potential targets. Sportsmail understands discussions have already taken place with a number of new additions. But will they also want to come to a club shorn of its idol? It is a big question and one that City will be desperate not to have to discover the answer to.

Manchester City have already indicated that a man who has also been linked with Manchester United and Arsenal in the past, is not in their sights, but Germany international Mertesacker insists Klopp would be a good fit in the English top flight. Jurgen Klopp has revealed he will be vacating his role as Borussia Dortmund boss at the end of the season Arsenal vice-captain Per Mertesacker says Klopp would be a top manager in the Premier League Klopp chats with Dortmund defender Erik Durm during a training session in Dortmund on Wednesday He said: 'I've got some nice experiences in the Premier League and of course it would be nice if a German coach would take the challenge of working in the Premier League. 'It's not so good for Dortmund that he is leaving but hopefully one day he will manage abroad. I think his passion would fit and to see him in England would be very interesting. 'Everyone has their philosophy and I think Jurgen Klopp has proved that he's top-level and can teach a lot.' However, Mertesacker insisted Klopp, whose side are 10th in the Bundesliga table, will need time to decide on his future after a largely successful spell in Dortmund which has brought two league titles and a Champions League final appearance. He said: 'I think he should just finish the season with Dortmund and then he should be given time.

        "doc": "Injury-ravaged Bayern Munich beat Hoffenheim 2-0 on Saturday, shrugging off a string of absences and their midweek Champions League defeat at Porto to close in on the Bundesliga title. Sebastian Rode scored in the 38th minute and Hoffenheim's Andreas Beck added an own goal in stoppage time as Bayern, with youngsters Mitchell Weiser and Gianluca Gaudino in the lineup, opened a 13-point lead over second-placed VfL Wolfsburg, in action against Schalke 04 on Sunday, with five matches left. The German champions, who host Porto on Tuesday in the Champions League quarter-final second leg after Wednesday's 3-1 loss, were without half a dozen starters, including Philipp Lahm, Arjen Robben, Franck Ribery and Bastian Schweinsteiger. Thomas Muller celebrates after Hoffenheim's Andreas Beck scored a stoppage time own goal But goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was in top form, spectacularly denying Anthony Modeste at point blank range after a defensive blunder by Brazilian Dante. Rode then made the most of Bayern's second chance of the game, curling his shot from the edge of the box past keeper Oliver Baumann. Rode was lucky not to be penalised for bringing down Eugen Polanski in the area a minute later but there was no denying the dominance of Bayern, who came close again when Robert Lewandowski scraped the bar at the start of the second-half. They did get a second goal when Thomas Mueller charged into the box and cut the ball back to the unfortunate Hoffenheim captain Beck who slipped the ball into his own net. Bayern's Sebastian Rode (eft) scores the opening goal from close range against Hoffenheim on Saturday Bayern Munich's players surround Sebastian Rode after he opened the scoring for the Bundesliga leaders Bayer Leverkusen crushed relegation-threatened visitors Hanover 96 4-0 to jump into third spot on goal difference after Borussia Moenchengladbach, also on 54 points, drew 0-0 at Eintracht Frankfurt on Friday.

In the images, which are featured in Frida Kahlo: The Gisèle Freund Photographs, the formidable painter is seen at her most relaxed, walking around her house in Mexico. The pictures portray the artist in her garden or languishing in her bed, giving an unparralled insight into her life with many of the pictures taken in the years before her death in 1954. Scroll down for video In the beautiful new pictures by Gisèle Freund the late artist Frida is seen at her most intimate, her she is pictured standing in her garden in Mexico Beautiful Frida poses in her house (left), in one picture she is seen lying in bed surrounded by books (right) Frida, whose real name was Frida Kahlo de Rivera, was a painter who was best known for her self portraits. These images were strong and she has become  a feminist icon for her striking and unapologetic style, her monobrow and signature, colourful outfits inspired by traditional Mexican  costume. The new  photographs were taken by Gisèle Freund, a German-born French photographer, who had travelled to Mexico in 1950. Having initially only planned to stay for two weeks she ended up staying for two years after becoming friends with Frida and her husband, artist Diego Rivera. Friday looks happy and relaxed here as she reclines on her sofa in a high necked shirt Frida Kahlo and Dr Juan Farill photographed in her home, 1951, they are standing in front of one of Frida's paintings that was done of the pair Frida Kahlo: The Gisèle Freund Photographs Photographs by Gisèle Freund Texts by Gérard de Cortanze, Gisèle Freund, and Lorraine Audric Published by Abrams Gisele lived with the couple and began taking many photographs of the pair as they went about their daily lives. In the introduction to the book, Cortanze quotes Freund's impressions of Kahlo which she had told to Rauda Jamis who wrote a book about the artist. She is said to have said: 'She was a formidable being, but in great distress … not only because of the physical pain due to her terrible tram accident but because she was a deeply conflicted being. 'She loved men, but did not turn away from women. She would shower you with gifts large and small, ranging from a charm, a tiny brass ex-voto, or a good luck stone to pre-Columbian pottery, as well as the heavy jewelry that she was crazy about … 'One day she told me: I don't want to live a long time. I am really suffering too much.' Frida spent much of her life in pain after a tram accident in 1925. Then a young woman she suffered serious injuries after the vehicle that she was riding in collided with a trolley car. These included damage to her spinal column, a broken collarbone, broken ribs, a broken pelvis, 11 fractures in her right leg, a crushed and dislocated right foot, and a dislocated shoulder. It was the accident which forced her to focus on her painting and give up a potential career in medicine which she had been studying. Kahlo painted to pass the time while she was stuck in bed during the time following the accident. She passed away at just 47 and it is reported that her marriage to Diego was a tumultuous. It is thought that both of them enjoyed extra-marital affairs with Diego angering his wife when he had a relationship with her sister. They divorced in 1939, however, they were back together again by 1940. For all of Frida's hard work though it wasn't really until after her death that her work began to gain world-wide recognition and over the years her pieces have been displayed around the world. Her unique look has also previously been emulated by many celebrities. The singer Beyonce once dressed up as Frida. Whilst in the artwork for her latest single 'B**** better have my money' she seems to have copied the artist's eyebrows. Some of the photographs show the inside of Frida's house, some of the walls of which were covered in pictures (left) she also kept dolls on her fireplace (right) There were many interesting artefacts in Frida's house including this turtle which was tucked away under a table Frida stands in the grounds of her gardens, her pose striking against the flora and fauna Frida stands in her garden a long shawl drapped elegantly around her shoulders",

Davis, 21, had lost her only career meeting with Bouchard, but was in control this time against the world No 7. Davis won nine of the final 11 games of the match and broke Bouchard's serve twice in the final set to pull off the upset. Eugenie Bouchard fires down a serve during her second-round match at the Family Circle Cup Bouchard shows her frustrations during her straight-sets defeat by Lauren Davis on Wednesday 'I've never beaten here before, so I came out knowing I had nothing to lose,' said Davis, ranked 66th in the world. Bouchard was a semi-finalist last year but had struggled in the lead-up to the Charlston green-clay event, losing three of her last five matches to lower-ranked opponents. Davis used precise groundstrokes to keep Bouchard on her heels throughout the second set. Davis broke Bouchard's serve to love to take a 3-1 lead as the 21-year-old Canadian had a double fault, then sailed a forehand long to fall behind. Two games later, Davis hit a backhand to send back Bouchard's 102mph serve for a winner down the left sideline and a 5-1 lead. Davis hits a forehand on her way to an impressive win against the Canadian top seed Bouchard has struggled recently, this time slumping to her fourth defeat in six matches The match ended on Bouchard's forehand into the net, Davis waving to the cheering crowd.

        "doc": "Lord Janner signed a letter saying he wanted to remain a peer just a week before he was ruled unfit to face child sex charges. Abuse campaigners last night angrily questioned why the suspected paedophile was able to remain in the House of Lords if he was too frail to be brought before court. The Crown Prosecution Service has faced widespread criticism since announcing last week that Janner would escape prosecution over child sex allegations because he has Alzheimer’s disease. But now it has emerged that the peer was apparently well enough to sign his name in an April 9 note to Lords authorities. Scroll down for video Controversy: Lord Janner, who will not face child sex charges because he has dementia, with his daughter, rabbi Laura Janner-Klausner Signed: The letter Lord Janner signed on April 9. His signature has been redacted for privacy reasons The former Labour MP, 86, claimed more than £100,000 in parliamentary expenses and allowances in the four years after he was diagnosed with dementia in 2009. He has not attended the Lords since detectives raided his North London home in December 2013. Last October he took a formal leave of absence from Parliament, allowing him to resume his duties after giving three months’ notice. New rules which came into effect last May provide a way for peers to retire permanently while keeping their titles and certain perks. But Janner requested an extension of his leave of absence instead of offering to stand down in the letter sent to a senior Lords official 12 days ago. A House of Lords spokesman confirmed the alleged paedophile signed the note himself, but could not confirm whether the handwriting below the signature was his. Simon Danczuk, the Labour politician who exposed the late Liberal MP Cyril Smith’s horrific abuse of boys, said it was not right for Janner to stay in the Lords yet avoid court. ‘If you are putting yourself forward to remain a legislator, then surely you are fit enough to be tested before the law,’ he said. ‘If he has got a leave of absence from the Lords, that implies that he may get well. Why isn’t he retiring? It makes a mockery of it all. He is bringing the House of Lords into disrepute almost single-handedly.’ The Crown Prosecution Service faced widespread criticism after announcing that Janner (pictured) would escape prosecution over child sex allegations because he has Alzheimer’s disease Pete Saunders, chief executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, added: ‘He couldn’t have signed this letter if he was non compos mentis. ‘But if he isn’t compos mentis, there’s no way he should be anywhere near our legislature. How can they say he’s not fit to stand trial for the most serious of crimes when he himself has argued that age should not be a barrier to prosecuting Nazi war criminals? ‘It stinks of the Establishment covering up and ensuring he doesn’t have to take the stand in public. This is a cover-up, there can be no question about it.’ Janner’s alleged victims have accused him of preying on boys at care homes around his former Leicester West constituency. He was suspended by Labour after the CPS ruled last Thursday that there was enough evidence to charge him with 22 sexual offences against children dating from 1969 to 1988. But Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said he would not be prosecuted because his deteriorating dementia means there could be no criminal conviction. Allegations against the peer were first made public in 1991 during the trial of Frank Beck, a manager of Leicester children’s homes accused of abusing more than 200 boys. After Beck was jailed, many other politicians spoke out in support of Janner in a Commons debate led by Leicestershire North West Tory MP David Ashby. Mr Ashby, 74, who stood down from Parliament in 1997 after being caught up in the Major government’s sleaze scandals, appeared to repeat his backing for the peer yesterday. ‘Of course I didn’t know anything at the time,’ he said from his home in South-West London. ‘The man has dementia and should be left alone.’ Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said she was aware of potential links between a key aide and the Lord Janner's QC son Prosecutors were forced to defend a senior legal adviser yesterday over fears of a conflict of interest in the Janner case. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said she was aware of potential links between a key aide and the Labour peer’s QC son. Neil Moore, who was based at the 23 Essex Street chambers where Daniel Janner works, was consulted by Mrs Saunders before she concluded not to prosecute. Senior police officers have privately raised concerns with her about Mr Moore’s involvement in the decision-making process. But a spokesman for the UK’s top prosecutor said she made the decision alone and that Mr Moore informed her of the connection before any discussions took place. She said Mr Moore was a barrister of the highest integrity and had not spoken to Mr Janner for two years. The potential for a conflict of interest is unhelpful for Mrs Saunders as she tackles the aftermath of her controversial decision. Last week it was revealed she over-ruled an expert in child abuse cases by deciding not to charge Janner. Eleanor Laws QC recommended a ‘trial of the facts’ in the defendant’s absence to ‘get to the bottom of the allegations’. A CPS spokesman said: ‘It is the DPP’s job to make these extremely difficult decisions, and that is what the DPP has done.’",

        "doc": "Lewis Hamilton has conceded to feeling more powerful now than at any stage in his F1 career. It is an ominous warning from a man who has won nine of the last 11 grands prix, been on pole at the last four, and who already holds a 27-point cushion in the drivers' standings. It is no wonder after winning in Bahrain, when Hamilton stepped out of his Mercedes, he immediately stood on top of it and pretended to smack an imaginary baseball out of the circuit. Lewis Hamilton stands on his Mercedes after winning the Bahrain Grand Prix It was another 'home run' performance from Hamilton, a man who claims he is a perfectionist, and who appears to be driving as close to perfection as can possibly be achieved in the sport. It led to the suggestion that perhaps he was feeling unbeatable, to which he replied: 'I don't know what the feeling of being unbeatable is. 'I know I feel very powerful in this car with the package we have, and I feel I'm able to get everything from it. 'I also feel more comfortable in this car than I did in the one last year, and I feel within myself, with whatever approach I have, the power is greater than ever in terms of strength in the car. 'It's like 'yes'. I put the car there and it goes there, I get the exit. 'Naturally you always feel there are things you can still improve on, but it's hard to always pinpoint what those are and to tell the team what to focus on. Hamilton is congratulated by Ferrari rival Kimi Raikkonen on Sunday 'That's what a team leader has to do, and, along with Nico (Rosberg), I'm trying to guide the team, to tell them where to go next.' So just how close to perfection does Hamilton feel? 'There are always areas. I'll look and think 'Could I have braked later for the pit entry? Could I have done a better outlap?' said the 30-year-old. 'I feel I'm doing the best I can, and I'm learning and improving at the same time, which is all I can ask for.' Yet do not dare to suggest to Hamilton that he does not work as hard off the track in terms of poring over every aspect of what is required to ensure he is at one with his car. In being compared with former McLaren team-mate Jenson Button in the past, or Rosberg at present, the feeling has generally been they are more studious than Hamilton, who simply just drives.

        "doc": "Tuesday, April 14, is Equal Pay Day. Here's the announcement presidential candidate Hillary Clinton should make:. \"Today in America, women earn on average 77 cents for every dollar men earn.  And the gap is even greater for women of color. That's unconscionable.  As president, my top priority will be fixing inequality and ensuring that 100% of the population is paid 100% of what they're worth.  And so, I'm announcing that if elected president, I will take a 23% pay cut, equivalent to the current gender wage gap, to stand in solidarity with working women in America. And I won't take a raise until every woman in America gets a raise, too.\" April 14 wasn't just chosen at random as Equal Pay Day. It's based on a calculation: For women to make the same amount of money that men made in 2014, they'd have to work until April 14, 2015. A woman on average loses $431,000 in pay over the course of a 40-year career. Merely closing the gender wage gap would pull half of working single moms out of poverty.  And at a time where Republicans are still, bizarrely, trumpeting more tax breaks for business and the rich to stimulate the economy, closing the pay gap would put money in the pockets of working people who would actually spend and stimulate real growth. The new women warriors: Reviving the fight for equal rights. So here's the perfect opportunity for Hillary Clinton to put her money where her mouth is, literally. In her campaign launch and personal rebrand, Clinton is clearly trying to portray herself as a woman of the people, a populist fighter for the middle class. \"Everyday Americans need a champion,\" Clinton said in her campaign launch video, \"and I want to be that champion.\" Clinton has deftly put her finger in the wind and sensed the winds of populism blowing through America. Indeed, the fact that many Democratic voters still clamor for a less pro-war, less pro-Wall Street, more Elizabeth Warren-like alternative to Clinton is an ever-present thorn in the otherwise blooming garden of Clinton's inevitability. Opinion: The myth of Equal Pay Day. With her video, Clinton has signaled a clear desire to ground herself and her candidacy in the soil of populism. But can a wealthy white woman who once sat on the board of Walmart, has already lived in the White House, collects six-figure speaking fees and doesn't seem to own a pair of jeans really inhabit the portrait of a populist fighter? This is where a good ol'-fashioned political stunt would come in handy.  And make no mistake about it, I'm recommending a political stunt. Let's call a spade a spade. Hillary Clinton is a very rich person. While she's certainly not the first rich person to run for president, her wealth -- and the related perception of being out of touch with ordinary Americans -- is an obstacle in her candidacy. The difference between the current standard presidential salary of $400,000 a year and the 77 cents-on-the-dollar version of that salary, or $308,000, is probably a drop in the bucket in Clinton's bank account at this point. And yet the symbolic power is profound. Because what Clinton would be reminding us is that across America, the aggregate salaries of all working women is 23% less than the aggregate salaries of all men. 78 cents on the dollar: The facts about the gender wage gap. Thanks to the hacked Sony emails, we saw that even top female stars and executives in Hollywood are paid less than their male counterparts. What more powerful message could the potential first female president send than literally signifying that nationwide inequity in her own salary? Clinton wouldn't just be saying she stands with the working women of America, she'd be showing it. Is it offensive to suggest that the first female commander in chief should be paid 23% less than her male predecessors for doing exactly the same work?  Yes. And that's the point -- to use her status to highlight the offensive gender wage gap and what Clinton, as president, would do to fix it. Yes, such stunts are trite and theatrical.  They're also effective, especially in our increasingly short-attention-span, it-only-happened-if-you-can-tweet it, symbolism-over-substance culture. Politics used to be about clunky people (mostly men) debating complex policies. Now it's about polished memes and even more polished candidates. Policy (I hope) still matters, but we're as likely to debate a candidate's \"image\" as her or his \"substance.\" The truth is that stunts and theatrics are now part and parcel of politics, as they are in our culture in general. That doesn't mean they can't also serve a noble purpose, in highlighting important problems and inspiring solutions. Map: Where the gender pay gap is the widest. Clinton did an arguably brilliant thing in her campaign launch, framing her video and presidential bid as not about her but the American people. In fact, Clinton didn't even appear in the video until the very end -- it was all about middle-class Americans, working hard, trying to get by and get ahead. And then we see Hillary, who wants to help. Hillary Clinton can't change who she is, the baggage attached to her by both the right and the left, rightly or wrongly. But she can change what she does going forward, how she shows up and signifies herself as a voice not for the status quo and the establishment -- but for ordinary Americans who need change. If Clinton wins, her presidency will indeed be symbolic and historic. And it will be significant if she does something to change the lives of the 158 million women in America.",

            "Yes, such stunts are trite and theatrical.  They're also effective, especially in our increasingly short-attention-span, it-only-happened-if-you-can-tweet it, symbolism-over-substance culture. Politics used to be about clunky people (mostly men) debating complex policies. Now it's about polished memes and even more polished candidates.

        "doc": "Tim Sherwood's jacket did not survive beyond the first 10 minutes and after this astonishing contest it remains to be seen if either of these sides fare much better. When Aston Villa's animated manager threw his gilet to the ground in celebration at the sight of Christian Benteke's first half equaliser, he probably rather hoped his players were man enough to remain in the Barclays Premier League after all. Indeed when he then saw Benteke convert the second of his three goals after 33 minutes, he may have felt his damning critique on Monday had provoked exactly the response he was looking for. But the grit, desire and determination his forwards had demonstrated was lacking at the opposite end of the field and a QPR side every bit as desperate to maintain their top flight status did a fine job of exposing exactly the weaknesses Sherwood had highlighted. Matt Phillips (left) headed Queens Park Rangers into a seventh-minute lead, getting on the end of Bobby Zamora's cross. Winger Phillips garnered just enough power on his head to plant beyond Brad Guzan in the Aston Villa goal . Joey Barton wheels away after watching Phillips nod in at the back post, as Ciaran Clark (left) and Carlos Sanchez appeal for offside . But QPR were only ahead for three minutes after Christian Benteke equalised for the hosts at Villa Park . Benteke drove beyond Rob Green from the edge of the box to net his seventh Premier League goal of the season. If it made for a hugely entertaining encounter, it must have been hell for the managers however friendly they might claim to be. Sherwood walked off the pitch at half-time with his hands planted casually in his pockets, comforted by the fact that his side were sitting five points clear of relegation danger. But when Charlie Austin followed Chint Hill's second half equaliser with a third goal for the visitors, Villa had replaced Chris Ramsey's spirited side in the bottom three. Only 12 minutes remained, and even if Benteke required just five more minutes to score again with a terrific free-kick the overriding feeling in the Villa ranks was certainly more one of frustration than relief. Benteke did not look like a man who wanted to enjoy his hat-trick at the sound of the final whistle. On the contrary, he looked devastated. Both sides have some difficult games ahead but when Tottenham and Manchester City come next for Villa, there is plenty to concern Sherwood. A replay of QPR's goals will not make pleasant viewing. The failure to close down Bobby Zamora before he delivered the cross that enabled Matt Phillips to strike after only seven minutes. The failure to challenge Hill and so stop him scoring his first Premier League goal. The failure too to respond to the threat being posed by Austin, who was allowed to take a touch to control the cross from Phillips before driving the ball past Brad Guzan. Such frailties could yet drag Villa down this season, and Sherwood knows it. 'We are not equipped unfortunately to go anywhere and dig out a result,' he complained afterwards, and on this evidence he would appear to be right. .  .

CLICK HERE to view our brilliant Match Zone - including Christian Benteke's second goal. Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood threw down his gilet in celebration after Benteke scored the early equaliser. Benteke was at the double in the opening 45, sweeping beyond Green to put Villa ahead just after the half hour. Defender Clint Hill was the unexpected scorer of QPR's equaliser just after half-time to make it 2-2. Hill grabs the Queens Park Rangers badge in celebration after scoring his first ever Premier League goal. Charlie Austin got ahead of Ron Vlaar and had looked as if he'd won the game for QPR. At times his side were excellent here, thrilling their supporters with a tremendous first half display. Phillips might have landed the first blow for QPR but the players he was probably referring to as 'the icing on the cake' were giving him plenty of cause for celebration. They were attacking with great flair and finesse, with the pace of individuals like Gabriel Agbonlahor and Leandro Bacuna and the sheer power of Benteke. The call for more men made Sherwood's selection of 19-year-old Jack Grealish somewhat curious. But the teenager too was performing well. More than man enough for the occasion. As a game it was something of an emotional rollercoaster, even if the warmth of the embrace between Sherwood and Ramsey before kick-off was soon replaced by the cold reality of a dire situation for both teams. Never one to hide his feelings, Sherwood responded to QPR's opening seventh minute goal by unzipping the aforementioned gilet in disgust. It was understandable really, given how meekly his defenders tried to stop Zamora from delivering the cross Phillips then headed home from close range. Only three minutes later and the same gilet was off altogether, Sherwood throwing it to the ground after seeing Benteke's shot take a nasty deflection off Mauricio Isla's trailing foot and loop over Rob Green. . The drama in the technical area added to the sense of excitement around Villa Park. The atmosphere was electric, the place almost erupting again when Grealish so nearly marked his first Premier League start with a goal. Benteke delivered a perfect ball into the path of the teenage winger only for Green to make the save at his feet. Sherwood's decision to play a midfield diamond and exploit the pace of his attackers was working well for Villa. Not everyone seemed to agree, and at one stage Sherwood seemed to be placating a fan who didn't seem quite so impressed. But his team were playing with real verve, with Benteke scoring a second after 33 minutes with a goal that owed as much to the speed, vision and courage of Agbonlahor as the precision of the finish. Agbonlahor was just quick enough to send Benteke clear before being hacked down by Sandro, and remained curled up in a ball while his colleague raced towards goal. Benteke finished cleverly, shaping to shoot beyond Hill before dragging his effort back inside the QPR defender and beyond the reach of a wrong-footed Green. . Austin salutes the travelling Rangers supporters inside Villa Park but they weren't able to cling on to the points . But Benteke's wonder free-kick, much like Jason Puncheon's on Monday night, meant Villa came away with a point. Benteke can't conceal his delight at completing his hat-trick and rescuing a point in the 83rd minute. Good friends Chris Ramsey (left) and Sherwood know each other well and were going head-to-head in the dugout for the first time. Former Villa striker Stan Collymore couldn't hit his elation in the press box after Benteke knocked in his second of the goal. Sherwood urges the supporters packed inside Villa Park to up the ante as they looked to move clear of trouble . Charlie Austin vies for possession with Kieran Richardson during an intense and entertaining first half. Niko Kranjcar attempts to get QPR back in the game but couldn't steer his effort beyond the American Guzan. Villa Park looked a picture on Tuesday night as the two relegation battlers went head-to-head in Birmingham . Sherwood said Ramsey was one of the finest coaches he had worked with and he certainly impressed here. He had seen how his forwards had been starved of service in the first half and responded after six minutes of the second by making two substitutions. It had the desired effect, Hill equalising four minutes later; punishment for what appeared to be Bacuna's failure to stay with his man. Austin's goal – his 17th in the Premier League this season - would be a further source of concern, even if Benteke did then level for a second time with a wonderful free-kick that beat Green via the inside of a post. Are they man enough? Only time will tell.",

        "doc": "The Miami Open is threatening to turn into national cake week, after Serena Williams became the latest recipient of a giant celebration present after she clocked her 700th career victory. The day following Andy Murray’s 500th win another huge cake was wheeled out to mark Williams reaching the semi-final with a 7-6, 1-6, 6-3 progression over Germany’s Sabine Lisicki. Williams’s hopes of another meeting with sister Venus were dashed by her elder sibling’s defeat to Spain’s Carla Suarez Navarro, but the world No 1 was intent on staying alive in what is the nearest thing she has to a hometown event. Serena Williams strikes a pose next to her cake after recording her 700th career victory. Williams beat Sabine Lisicki in three sets on Wednesday to progress to the semi-finals of the Miami Open.

        "doc": "Adam Federici lay inert on the turf for a moment. He realised the magnitude of what happened. He understood the horror of it instantly. He let his head rest on the grass and closed his eyes as if he was trying to wish it all away, as if he was trying to blot out the din and the agony and the wild celebrations of the Arsenal fans. His face was scrunched against the grass, distorted in a mask of despair. Reading, still struggling to avoid relegation to League One, had performed heroically to push Arsenal into extra-time in this FA Cup semi-final and Federici had pulled off a series of stunning saves to keep the sides level at 1-1 but the Australian goalkeeper guessed there would be no way back now. There had been less than a minute to go before the extra-time interval when Alexis Sanchez had cut in from the left and fired in a stinging shot straight at Federici. He knelt to gather it but somehow it squirmed through his legs and trickled over the line as he scrambled in vain to retrieve it. It was football at its most cruel. In years to come, it will be the enduring image of this game. Alexis Sanchez's low shot squirmed agonisingly through the legs of Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici in extra time. It was a routine shot from Sanchez but the Reading stopper failed to collect it properly in his grasp - an embarrassing gaffe. The ball rolled through his legs and slowly towards the goal line in the 106th minute of the game. Federici tries desperately to stop the ball going over the line after it rolled through his legs and out of his grasp. Reading had fought valiantly but were unable to score another equaliser to take the tie to penalties. Federici lies slumped on the ground as the impact of his error hits him in the FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal. The Reading goalkeeper, who had been magnificent until then, left the field in tears as manager Steve Clarke tries to console him. Federici's opposite number, Wojciech Szczesny (left) of Arsenal comforts his fellow goalkeeper after the game is resolved. Reading: Federici, Gunter, Hector, Pearce, Obita, McCleary, Williams, Chalobah (Cox, 106), Robson-Kanu (Karacan, 90), Mackie, Pogrebnyak (Yakubu, 111). . Subs not used: Stephen Kelly, Norwood, Yakubu, Andersen, Cooper. Booked: Chalobah. Goal: McCleary, 54 . Arsenal: Szczesny, Debuchy, Mertesacker (Gabriel, 63), Koscielny, Gibbs, Coquelin (Walcott, 101), Cazorla, Ramsey, Ozil, Sanchez, Welbeck (Giroud, 72). . Subs not used: Wilshere, Ospina,  Monreal, Flamini. Goals: Sanchez 39, 106. When the final whistle confirmed that it would be Arsenal who will face either Liverpool or Aston Villa here at the end of next month, Federici, 30, put his head down and began to walk purposefully from the pitch, his thoughts fixed on some form of escape, some search for sanctuary. The Reading manager, Steve Clarke, tried to console him but he was inconsolable. As he disappeared down the tunnel, he hung his head and wept. Sure, the bigger picture was that Arsenal now have a chance to become the most successful club in the history of this competition by winning it for the second year in succession. The bigger picture is that this time, their success in the FA Cup seems less like a consolation prize and more like a gateway to a new period of glories at a club that had been starved of them until last season’s Cup final victory over Hull. But above all, this was the kind of human drama that peoples this competition and adds to its legend. ‘I am happy we are through,’ said Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny. ‘But I thought Federici was terrific today. He had the game of his life and they only got to extra-time because of him. He was the best player on the pitch. I really feel for him — I have been there, done that.’. Clarke did his best to ease Federici’s pain, too. ‘This is the life of a goalkeeper,’ said the Reading boss. ‘And Adam is a top goalkeeper. There’s every chance he’ll be Reading’s player of the season this year. His performances in the Championship have been crucial. ‘We stick by him. I understand his worth and the supporters understand how important he is. Adam is a strong character as well. He’ll take his disappointment on the chin and on Wednesday night when we play Birmingham I’m sure he’ll be as good as he always is.’. Clarke also complained that refereeing decisions had counted against his team. He had some justification but nothing can dull the memory of how his side pushed Arsenal all the way. There were times when it seemed Arsene Wenger’s team, who had been pegged back by the Championship strugglers in normal time, might be overwhelmed by the sheer relentless refusal of their opponents to accept defeat and by a team spirit that would not fade. The match became a test of Arsenal’s fortitude as well as their class. In former years, they might have buckled. . Sanchez leaps skywards to celebrate his second goal of the game for Arsenal against Reading. Sanchez (left) rifles Arsenal into the lead against Reading in the FA Cup semi-final against Reading. Arsenal had an inconsistent first half before Sanchez struck clinically after Mesut Ozil passed to him excellently. Sanchez (third right) turns away in celebration as Reading's players lay crumpled on the ground after conceding . Striker Sanchez (right)  celebrates alongside team-mate Keiran Gibbs after scoring for Arsenal against Reading. Gareth McCleary's second-half strike went over the line for Reading after a deflection from Keiran Gibbs . McCleary runs over to the Reading supporters at Wembley to celebrate scoring the equaliser for the Championship side. Reading's players celebrate the goal with McCleary as they pulled themselves level with Arsenal at Wembley in the semi-final. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger (centre) gives instructions out to his team before the beginning of extra time. Federici’s mistake gave them an escape route that they followed eagerly. They had nearly taken an early lead when Per Mertesacker rose to meet a corner at the near post and Federici had to dive smartly to his left to push it off the line. Later, he produced a stunning one-handed stop to keep out a header from Gabriel. Reading held firm but Arsenal started to exert more and more pressure. Mesut Ozil, in particular, was a delight to watch in possession. There are increasing signs that the German is finally beginning to find his best form and he beguiled Reading with a series of sweet turns and beautifully measured passes. Seven minutes before the interval, Arsenal broke the stalemate. It was Ozil, inevitably, who was the inspiration. He collected the ball midway inside the Reading half, took time to pick his pass and flighted a curling ball to Sanchez in the box. Sanchez did the rest, although the rest was not simple. He controlled the ball on his chest with his back to goal, turned and committed Garath McCleary by shaping to shoot. Then, with time, the Chilean forward prodded the ball past Federici and wheeled away to celebrate. . Gabriel (right), a replacement for Per Mertesacker, powers a header at goal shortly after Reading had scored. But Reading goalkeeper Federici made a splendid one-handed save to tip the ball up and against the crossbar. Sanchez (centre) earlier took the ball past goalkeeper  Federici (second left) before losing his footing and falling. Daniel Williams (left) shoots at goal for Reading against Arsenal at Wembley but his attempt went wide of the goal. It seemed then that Arsenal would extend their lead. Reading’s threat had been negligible. But they came out for the second half with new belief and to the delight of their fans massed behind the goal, they forced an equalizer. Pavel Pogrebnyak must take a lot of the credit for squeezing in a cross when it looked as though he had run out of space near the byline. The ball drifted over Kieran Gibbs’ head and as Szczesny scrambled across his line, McCleary volleyed the ball back across him. Szczesny got his hands to it but he had not been able to prevent it crossing the line. Suddenly, Reading wanted more. Jamie Mackie clipped a lovely chip into the path of Danny Williams on the edge of the box. It fell to him nicely but Williams sliced his volley wildly wide. The game was harum-scarum now. Reading sensed an upset. Mackie urged the fans on and they roared back. But six minutes from the end of normal time, Reading escaped when Aaron Ramsey missed an open goal, crashing a left-foot shot against the post. Ramsey held his head in his hands. Redemption was not far away for him. It will take longer to greet Federici. Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck (centre) has an effort blocked by Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici.

Tries: Nil Penalties: Hodgson (2), Goode, Bosch Conversions: Nil . ‘The last time I kicked to win the game was when I was 21 and playing for an amateur club in Argentina,’ said Bosch. 'It was from more or less the same range and it was against our clasico rivals. It was a great memory for me, but it was a long time ago. ‘I tried to be as relaxed as possible. We had the wind in our face and I didn’t want to force it. I tried not to think about what it represented and I said, “Why not? I can take it.” The rest is history. With kicks like this, you’re either the hero or the bad guy - I’m happy that it went my way.’. It was the sort of strike that was associated with Ronan O’Gara during his illustrious playing career with Munster and Ireland. The retired No 10, now kicking coach for the Top 14 side, watched helplessly from the stands of the Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir as the ball sailed between the posts to set up a knockout meeting with Clermont in Saint Etienne. .

CLERMONT v SARACENS, Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, St Etienne, Saturday, April 18, 3.15pm (GMT) TOULON v LEINSTER, Stade Vélodrome, Marseille, Sunday,     April 19, 3.15pm (GMT) Racing are a team who, in their early years, would play wearing berets and bow ties. They would drink champagne at half time but this was an abrasive and at times unabsorbing encounter, offering little to inspire the Parisian painters couched on the sidelines to capture the moments of magic. The partisan home crowd were angered by two of Owens’ decisions in the opening quarter, with the Welshman not penalising Alex Goode for a block on French winger Teddy Thomas and scratching off a potential try for Dimitri Szarzewski because of a knock on. Charlie Hodgson kicked two first-half penalties – either side of a 27th minute try for Maxime Machenaud after Saracens lost an attacking scrum - Jim Hamilton was shown a yellow card, the tourists were fortunate to go into the break with a one-point advantage. ‘We weren't great in the first half, even though we had a very strong wind,’ said Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall. ‘We were unable to build any pressure. Playing into that very strong wind and with Jonny Sexton playing No 10 for the opposition, being 6-5 up at half time felt like a mountain to climb.  . Marcelo Bosch is an Argentine utility back who moved to Europe in 2006 to play for Biarritz. He joined Saracens in the 2013-14 season and has featured predominantly at centre. He is not Saracens’ first-choice kicker - Owen Farrell, Charlie Hodgson and Alex Goode are all above him - but he has a hugely powerful strike. It’s earned him cult status with the Allianz Park crowd, who chant ‘Bosch, Bosch, Bosch’ whenever he lines up one of his kicks. As a teenager, Bosch played football in Buenos Aires but claims that it was always his dream to play rugby in England. He married Augustina last summer and they are expecting twins. . Bosch's football skills aid his powerful kicking. Racing Metro 92 winger Teddy Thomas shows his speed to avoid Chris Wyles and escape the in-goal area.

We went hunting and kept knocking them down, scrapping for absolutely everything. Our rugby could have been better and it wasn't a beauty of a match, but we put them under enough pressure to make some errors and give us a chance.’. Cigarette smoke filled the air and, having never previously progressed from the pool stages, the hosts looked like they were choking on the pressure. Racing did most of the running but Saracens edged further ahead, with Goode also adding his weight to the kicking with a 47th minute penalty. Wales and Racing centre Jamie Roberts threatened in attack, but was hauled off in the 52nd minute. Bosch then tackled his countryman Juan Imhoff just short of the line – although the pitch-length move was subsequently pulled back for a forward pass – and Billy Vunipola intervened with a crucial turnover to snuff out a Racing attack. But Saracens were unable to build upon their lead and, just past the hour mark, Racing narrowed the gap thanks to three points from Machenaud. A game of kick tennis ensued and the French No 9 pushed his side into the lead with his second penalty 10 minutes later. The blue and white flags were waving and the bass drum was beating but, sacrebleu, Metro tried to run down the clock. Then Metz came flying off his feet at the crucial moment. Bosch stepped up for the penalty and, after a short run up, his kick floated gracefully between the sticks. .

        "doc": "Wayne Rooney knows Champions League qualification is Manchester United's to lose, making this weekend's clash with Aston Villa all the more important. Louis van Gaal's side sit fourth in the Barclays Premier League standings as the season enters the closing stages, boasting a five-point cushion over the chasing pack after winning so impressively at Liverpool before the international break. Juan Mata's brace earned United a deserved 2-1 triumph at Anfield to give them a buffer over the Reds, as well as fellow top-four contenders Southampton and Tottenham. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney feels the club are on course to qualify for the Champions League. United midfielder Juan Mata scored a fantastic brace against Liverpool to secure his side a 2-1 win at Anfield. The second of Mata's goals was a brilliant improvised scissor kick to give United a 2-0 lead in the second-half. However, Rooney is well aware how quickly things can change, admitting nothing less than victory will suffice when Aston Villa come to Aston Villa on Saturday. 'Yes it was (a six-pointer at Liverpool), but that means nothing if we don't beat Aston Villa on Saturday,' the United captain said. 'Obviously Arsenal play Liverpool as well, so if we can get the win against Villa that will be an even better result than Liverpool was for us. 'I think there are still eight games left. We are in a good position at the minute so it's in our own hands, so have to make sure we do it.' Rooney and several of his United team-mates only returned home from international duty on Wednesday afternoon after a technical fault on the England team plane delayed their departure from Turin. It meant an extra night in Italy, where it looked like they would be leaving after a night to forget as Graziano Pelle punished the Three Lions' poor first-half display. However, Andros Townsend's wonder strike saw England secure a 1-1 draw following a much-improved performance after half-time, when Roy Hodgson's bold substitutions paid off - as did his decision to partner Rooney with full debutant Harry Kane. The England skipper had spent the first half in midfield role as Hodgson tinkered with his side, although he is not allowing that experimentation to be an excuse. 'I think it's important in tournament football you might need that, so that's what we were doing,' the 29-year-old said. Rooney competes for the ball with Italy defender Andrea Ranocchia during Tuesday's international friendly . Rooney runs forward with the ball during the friendly match at the Juventus Stadium in Turin on Tuesday. 'We were trying a few different things out because you never know with injuries and suspensions in tournament football. The best time to do it is obviously in the friendlies. 'You could clearly see in the first half that it didn't work so I think the manager made good changes at the right time which helped us to get back into the game. 'Obviously I haven't played in midfield for a few weeks. Sometimes it is difficult to go from up front to midfield or from midfield to up front - sometimes it does take time. 'I had a few chances and could have scored, so I felt I played better when I went up front.' United team-mate Phil Jones was another to struggle away from his preferred position, looking lost at times at the base of the diamond. He looked more assured when he dropped back into defence after Chris Smalling complained of feeling unwell and was replaced by Michael Carrick late in the opening period. The 33-year-old had not played for England since October 2013 before these matches and Rooney loves having his club-mate around. 'I felt Michael Carrick was the best player on the pitch by a mile,' he said. 'He gave us great composure, he slowed the game down when we needed to and started our attacks really well.' Asked if Carrick has been under-rated throughout his career, Rooney said: 'Not from me and certainly not from Manchester United fans. 'I think he is a fantastic player. He has been a big reason why, at United, we have won so many trophies over the last few years. So from myself and his team-mates, he has not been under-estimated.' United and England midfielder Michael Carrick has been singled out for his strong performance against Italy.  .",

        "doc": "Ronny Deila lauded his players for stretching their lead at the top of the Premiership with victory at St Mirren – then hit out at the state of pitches in Scotland. A James Forrest strike and Stefan Johansen’s penalty were enough to see off a spirited challenge by the bottom side as Celtic moved eight points clear of Aberdeen. But although pleased with the way his side stayed patient to win, Deila felt their cause wasn’t helped by the state of the Paisley surface. And he believes Scottish football will struggle to develop top players if there isn’t a drastic improvement in our pitches. Celtic manager Ronny Deila was impressed with his side's performance against St Mirren on Friday night. ‘It was a tough game, St Mirren were well organised and played very deep,’ he said. ‘They fought really hard and it was difficult to break them down. We had to be patient. The pitch was better than some others we’ve played on. But the pitches in Scotland are terrible. ‘If you want to develop players and get passing football, it’s difficult when the ball is bouncing all the time. It’s much easier for the other teams to just sit behind the ball and try to break down our play. ‘It’s better to play on an artificial surface than this. If they are watering artificial pitches and they are of the best quality, it’s totally different and much closer to European standards. James Forrest slides on his knees to celebrate scoring Celtic's opening goal against St Mirren. ‘If we are going to develop good young players, you need a good surface to play and train on. If not, you get fighters. If you want skills and technique, play on better surfaces. ‘They are much better in Norway. Sixty per cent are artificial and the grass pitches are better as well because they don’t train there and there aren’t other teams playing on them. And we play in the summer. That’s the biggest thing. The pitch here might not look so bad but try to play on it.’. TV pictures showed Leigh Griffiths eating a chocolate biscuit while sitting on the bench. But Deila, a strong advocate of fitness and conditioning, laughed it off. ‘I think it was a carbo biscuit which is totally different! I’ll have to check his weight tomorrow.’. Celtic midfielder Stefan Johansen slots home from the penalty spot to secure his side's 2-0 victory. Goalscorer Johansen believes there’s no stopping Celtic as they close in on a treble. ‘It looks great for us now,’ he said. ‘I don’t think we’re unbeatable but there is a huge confidence in the team. ‘We are starting to look fitter and have much more of the ball because we’re playing with a higher tempo. That’s the way the manager wants us to play. I said in the beginning when people were asking questions I was confident he would be a great and it’s starting to look that way.’. Saints boss Gary Teale felt there were positives in defeat but wasn’t happy about the handball awarded against Viktor Genev for Celtic’s penalty. ‘Was it ball to hand or hand to ball?

        "doc": "While the fight against ISIS in Syria and Iraq holds the world's gaze, a simultaneous transformation is getting less attention: the deterioration of al Qaeda. In an audio message released Sunday, al Qaeda confirmed that two of its leaders, known as Ustad Ahmad Farooq and Qari Abdullah Mansur, were killed in CIA drone strikes in January in North Waziristan, near the Afghan-Pakistan border. Farooq's real name was Raja Mohammad Suleman, al Qaeda said. He was a Pakistani who acted as the group's liaison to the Pakistan Taliban and was the deputy commander of al Qaeda's South Asia branch. (Mansur's real name was Qari Ubaidullah, a Pakistani who oversaw suicide missions against U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan). Al Qaeda's South Asia branch is relatively new, announced with some fanfare back in September by al Qaeda's top leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri. The creation of the terror group's South Asia branch was seen by some terrorism analysts as an attempt to steal some of the limelight from ISIS, which is embroiled in a public dispute with al Qaeda for leadership of the global jihad movement. The deaths of the two men continue the decimation of al Qaeda's bench of leaders. On Monday, in the southern Pakistani city of Karachi, local al Qaeda commander Nurul Hassan was killed in a raid, said Arif Hanif, district inspector general of police. Florida-raised Adnan Shukrijumah, 39, who was in charge of al Qaeda's operations to attack the West, was killed in December in a Pakistani military operation. Texas-born Mohanad Mahmoud Al Farekh, who also played a planning role for al Qaeda's operations, was arrested in Pakistan last year. The deaths of Ubaidullah and Suleman underline the fact that there are almost no top leaders of al Qaeda left except al-Zawahiri. Both Ubaidullah and Suleman were Pakistani. This is an indicator of how al Qaeda has become a largely Pakistan-focused group, increasingly able to do nothing of any significance outside of Pakistan or Afghanistan. Indeed, al Qaeda has virtually no capacity to carry out attacks in the West. The last successful al Qaeda attack in the West was the London transportation system bombings a decade ago. Al Qaeda is now reduced only to holding American hostages such as 73-year-old aid worker Warren Weinstein, who was kidnapped from his home in the Pakistani city of Lahore on August 13, 2011. To be sure, al Qaeda's Yemen-based affiliate, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, continues to pose a threat to American aviation. The group has built hard-to-detect bombs, which it has placed on U.S.-bound flights. Luckily, those bombs were faulty or were detected. The group also trained one of the gunmen who attacked the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris in January, killing 12, but it's not clear if AQAP had any direct role in planning this attack. Meanwhile, ISIS continues to attract Western recruits and also inspire \"homegrown\" terrorists in the West, but the core al Qaeda organization that killed almost 3,000 men, women and children on 9/11 is on life support. Al Qaeda's confirmation of the deaths of Ubaidullah and Suleman is just one of the latest pieces of evidence for this assessment.",

        "doc": "Tuesday, April 14, is Equal Pay Day. Here's the announcement presidential candidate Hillary Clinton should make:. \"Today in America, women earn on average 77 cents for every dollar men earn.  And the gap is even greater for women of color. That's unconscionable.  As president, my top priority will be fixing inequality and ensuring that 100% of the population is paid 100% of what they're worth.  And so, I'm announcing that if elected president, I will take a 23% pay cut, equivalent to the current gender wage gap, to stand in solidarity with working women in America. And I won't take a raise until every woman in America gets a raise, too.\" April 14 wasn't just chosen at random as Equal Pay Day. It's based on a calculation: For women to make the same amount of money that men made in 2014, they'd have to work until April 14, 2015. A woman on average loses $431,000 in pay over the course of a 40-year career. Merely closing the gender wage gap would pull half of working single moms out of poverty.  And at a time where Republicans are still, bizarrely, trumpeting more tax breaks for business and the rich to stimulate the economy, closing the pay gap would put money in the pockets of working people who would actually spend and stimulate real growth. The new women warriors: Reviving the fight for equal rights. So here's the perfect opportunity for Hillary Clinton to put her money where her mouth is, literally. In her campaign launch and personal rebrand, Clinton is clearly trying to portray herself as a woman of the people, a populist fighter for the middle class. \"Everyday Americans need a champion,\" Clinton said in her campaign launch video, \"and I want to be that champion.\" Clinton has deftly put her finger in the wind and sensed the winds of populism blowing through America. Indeed, the fact that many Democratic voters still clamor for a less pro-war, less pro-Wall Street, more Elizabeth Warren-like alternative to Clinton is an ever-present thorn in the otherwise blooming garden of Clinton's inevitability. Opinion: The myth of Equal Pay Day. With her video, Clinton has signaled a clear desire to ground herself and her candidacy in the soil of populism. But can a wealthy white woman who once sat on the board of Walmart, has already lived in the White House, collects six-figure speaking fees and doesn't seem to own a pair of jeans really inhabit the portrait of a populist fighter? This is where a good ol'-fashioned political stunt would come in handy.  And make no mistake about it, I'm recommending a political stunt. Let's call a spade a spade. Hillary Clinton is a very rich person. While she's certainly not the first rich person to run for president, her wealth -- and the related perception of being out of touch with ordinary Americans -- is an obstacle in her candidacy. The difference between the current standard presidential salary of $400,000 a year and the 77 cents-on-the-dollar version of that salary, or $308,000, is probably a drop in the bucket in Clinton's bank account at this point. And yet the symbolic power is profound. Because what Clinton would be reminding us is that across America, the aggregate salaries of all working women is 23% less than the aggregate salaries of all men. 78 cents on the dollar: The facts about the gender wage gap. Thanks to the hacked Sony emails, we saw that even top female stars and executives in Hollywood are paid less than their male counterparts. What more powerful message could the potential first female president send than literally signifying that nationwide inequity in her own salary? Clinton wouldn't just be saying she stands with the working women of America, she'd be showing it. Is it offensive to suggest that the first female commander in chief should be paid 23% less than her male predecessors for doing exactly the same work?  Yes. And that's the point -- to use her status to highlight the offensive gender wage gap and what Clinton, as president, would do to fix it. Yes, such stunts are trite and theatrical.  They're also effective, especially in our increasingly short-attention-span, it-only-happened-if-you-can-tweet it, symbolism-over-substance culture. Politics used to be about clunky people (mostly men) debating complex policies. Now it's about polished memes and even more polished candidates. Policy (I hope) still matters, but we're as likely to debate a candidate's \"image\" as her or his \"substance.\" The truth is that stunts and theatrics are now part and parcel of politics, as they are in our culture in general. That doesn't mean they can't also serve a noble purpose, in highlighting important problems and inspiring solutions. Map: Where the gender pay gap is the widest. Clinton did an arguably brilliant thing in her campaign launch, framing her video and presidential bid as not about her but the American people. In fact, Clinton didn't even appear in the video until the very end -- it was all about middle-class Americans, working hard, trying to get by and get ahead. And then we see Hillary, who wants to help. Hillary Clinton can't change who she is, the baggage attached to her by both the right and the left, rightly or wrongly. But she can change what she does going forward, how she shows up and signifies herself as a voice not for the status quo and the establishment -- but for ordinary Americans who need change. If Clinton wins, her presidency will indeed be symbolic and historic. And it will be significant if she does something to change the lives of the 158 million women in America.",

And the gap is even greater for women of color. That's unconscionable.  As president, my top priority will be fixing inequality and ensuring that 100% of the population is paid 100% of what they're worth.

And I won't take a raise until every woman in America gets a raise, too.\" April 14 wasn't just chosen at random as Equal Pay Day. It's based on a calculation: For women to make the same amount of money that men made in 2014, they'd have to work until April 14, 2015. A woman on average loses $431,000 in pay over the course",

        "doc": "It's probable that Thiago Alcantara would never have signed for Manchester United even if David Moyes had wanted him. Once Pep Guardiola had made it clear he required the midfelder at Bayern Munich, it was pointless for United to continue their pursuit anyway,. But the fact that Moyes wasn't keen on the transfer - 'not his type' said a club source - was probably an early indication that he wasn't the right fit for United. Not that Moyes is a bad judge of a player; all managers get it wrong at some point. However, United's need for passing quality from deep midfield was apparent throughout Moyes' short time at the club. Indeed, it has continued to be a problem until Michael Carrick fully recovered from injury and Ander Herrera began to find his feet. The kind of passing display Thiago delivered in Bayern's 6-1 win over Porto on Wednesday has been precisely what United have been missing. Thiago (right) heads in Bayern Munich's first goal during their 6-1 win over Porto on Tuesday night. Thiago blows a kiss to the crowd as he celebrates his goal which started Bayern's remarkable comeback. Thiago is congratulated on his strike by Pep Guardiola, the man who took him from Barcelona to Bayern. Without quality in that area, few teams can compete at the elite level any more. It used to be the case that a requirement of playing holding midfield was height, strength and an ability to tackle. Given that most distribution emanates from deep, being among the best passers of the ball in that position is infinitely more important now. Moyes might quite reasonably been worried that Thiago was on the slight side to thrive in the rough and tumble of the Premier League. And his troubles with repeated knee ligaments injuries until his comeback this year add some weight to that theory - he was much missed by Spain at the World Cup after pulling out with a knee injury. But there are few players in the world who can pass like Thiago. Gary Neville has spoken about how Paul Scholes was once among that small group of players who could dictate a game simply with the tempo and the accuracy of their passing. Andrea Pirlo and Xavi are two more from Scholes' generation. Thiago is now elevating himself to their level. One experienced German journalist who has been watching Bayern for 35 years commented last night: 'Thiago might well be the most technically-gifted central midfielder who has ever played for Bayern.' . Thiago dictated the pace of the game from deep for Bayern Munich as they crushed Porto. Thiago started his career at Barcelona but was overlooked for Cesc Fabregas (right) by boss Tito Vilanova. And no-one has invested more in Thiago than Guardiola, which is why United had no realistic chance of signing him once his offer had been made. It was Pep who promoted him to the first team at Barcelona in 2009 and made him an integral part of the squad. But when Pep left, his successor, the late Tito Vilanova, wanted Cesc Fabregas to play that role. Thiago was sidelined, hence his availability in the summer of 2013. He is very much a global footballer for the 21st century. His dad, of course, is Brazilian, the World Cup winner Mazinho; Thiago was born in Italy and raised in Spain. He opted to play for the country in which he was living, rather than that of his forefathers or his birth, and was outstanding for Spain in the European Under 21 championships in 2013, scoring a hat-trick in the final against Italy in a 4-2 win. At Barcelona they are said not to be disturbed by the rise of Thiago. Ivan Rakitic and Sergio Busquets have that position covered. But Xavi is off to Qatar and Cesc is at Chelsea. Should Barca end up against Bayern in the Champions League semi finals, they may yet rue the day they deemed him surplus to requirements. David Moyes believed Thiago may not be able to cope with the physical demands of the Premier League.  .",

        "doc": "Gary Player will attend his 58th Masters this week fully expecting to welcome a new member to the game’s most exclusive club and salute what he considers would be one of the sport’s finest accomplishments. The great man considers Tiger Woods completing the career Grand Slam at the age of just 24 as the best golfing feat he has seen. So you can imagine how excited he is at the prospect of Rory McIlroy becoming just the sixth player to win all four majors at only 25. ‘I’m not sure people fully realise what a magnificent effort it would be,’ said the South African legend. ‘When I completed my Slam at 29 I said to my wife that you will never see that done again. Then Jack Nicklaus came along and did it at 26 and then Tiger at 24. Jack Nicklaus watches his shot go for a birdie on the 17th at the Masters golf tournament in Augusta in 1986. Rory McIlroy meets up with South African Golf Legend Gary Player during the pro-am in 2009. Rory McIlroy, pictured in action at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, and is favourite to win the Masters. ‘Now we have Rory, and I tell you this: I honestly believe he is going to do it. I just believe everything is going to fall into place for him, that he will learn from the mistakes he made when he messed up in 2011 and put everything right.’. It is not hard to see why Player would have such a special affinity for McIlroy. Two men of similar stature who came from a foreign land to take on the Americans in the majors in their own backyard; two men with a commitment to fitness with minds strong enough to ward off all the criticism. Forget Tiger. It was Player, of course, who wrote the book when it came to golfers and fitness. Heavens, he is still doing 1,300 sit-ups and squatting 300lb every morning even now, at the age of 79. He is withering in his contempt of those who say McIlroy is ‘bulking up’ too much in the gym. ‘I’m going to guess most of the critics are fat and don’t watch what they eat,’ he says. ‘Just because they’re lazy, they can’t grasp that fitness is so vital. Tom Watson presents Player with a Green Jacket after the 1978 Masters Tournament at Augusta National. ‘I was told that because I was so keen on fitness my career in golf would be over early and I wouldn’t win any tournaments after the age of 34. I was told I had no chance of winning the US Open if I was squatting 325lb the previous evening. What rubbish. ‘I’m just so pleased to see travelling gymnasiums on the circuit and that most players see the value of putting themselves through the pain barrier. I used to go down to the local YMCA wherever we were playing and sometimes wait 20 minutes to use the equipment. But it you want to be a superstar, and by a superstar I mean a player who has won at least six majors, there are no short cuts. Woods could pose a threat to McIlroy at the Masters after confirming that he will play at Augusta . ‘Rory will be an absolute superstar when he wins the Masters. And yes, I can see a lot of similarities with myself. I love the fact he is a people person, for example, and engages with the fans. That’s what I used to love, and still do. So many pros can’t be bothered to talk to the fans and it’s so wrong.’ Player also gives short shrift to the idea that completing the career Grand Slam is a modern media invention. ‘I tell you it was electrifying when I completed it in 1965,’ he said. ‘I so wanted to follow Gene Sarazen and particularly Ben Hogan and become the third player to achieve it, because Hogan was the best player I’d seen. Jack and I were both in competition to complete it and it was a piece of advice Jack gave me that helped me over the line. ‘I was due to play a tournament at Greensboro in 1965 when Jack said if I wanted to win the US Open and complete the set I should go with him to the US Open site and practise. I said I needed the money, that I had loads of children to look after, but I went with him. So he played a key role. McIlroy manages a smile after throwing away a four-shot lead on the final day of the Masters in 2011. Jack Nicklaus  waves before hitting his drive at the ceremonial start of the 2014 Masters golf tournament. ‘It was amazing afterwards. Everyone wanted to know how a man from a small country who lost his mother at the age of eight and his dad worked in a mine could achieve such a thing. How on earth could it happen?’. Player and Nicklaus have remained lifelong friends. They will be partners in a team competition in the autumn before Player heads to Greece for his 80th birthday celebrations. ‘There will be 35 people there and Jack and I will need to win that event for me to be able to pay for it,’ said Player, laughing. As for Augusta, he is looking forward as ever to hitting the ceremonial first shot on Thursday alongside Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer. And then, 50 years on from his own date with history, he will join every other fascinated observer to see if another non-American can complete the set of majors and join him on what former US Open champion Curtis Strange evocatively refers to as golf’s Mount Rushmore.",

        "doc": "The Fulham fans in the Jimmy Steed Stand applauded their team at the final whistle. It was not the victory manager Kit Symons had called for but a point away to Charlton probably secures their future in the Championship next season. They are eight points clear of Millwall and bar a miraculous resurgence from one of the bottom three sides will stay up but the fact relegation is still mathematically feasible for a club that were in the Premier League last season is alarming. A vertiginous decline, just one victory in their last seven games had seen them dragged back into a relegation battle and after a painful 4-1 trouncing by bitter rivals Brentford last week, Symons was looking for a quick response from his players. . Johann Gudmundsson celebrates his first-half effort as Charlton come from behind to earn a point. The Icelandic winger is joined by his Charlton teammates as they celebrate his equaliser at The Valley. He got it with Ross McCormack giving them the lead after eight minutes. A superb long ball by Michael Turner found Matt Smith who headed on to the Scotsman to loop the ball over the top of Charlton goalkeeper Stephen Henderson in front of the 1620 travelling fans in the Jimmy Seed stand. The passage of time has clearly not dulled the bad feeling Charlton fans harbour towards Scott Parker. The midfielder, who missed the Brentford game through illness, departed the club more than a decade ago but his every touch of the ball was greeted by a chorus of boos. Not that it seemed to affect him as he dictated the pace of the game in the early stages, feeding striker Smith well. Ross McCormack headed over a stranded Stephen Henderson with just eight minutes played in London . McCormack celebrates his goal in front of the traveling Fulham fans with just eight minutes played. Charlton Athletic: Henderson, Gomez, Ben Haim, Johnson, Fox, Johann Gudmundsson, Cousins, Diarra, Bulot (Eagles 70) Vetokele (Church 79) Watt. Subs: Bikey Amougou, Wiggins, Lennon, Dmitrovic, Lepoint. Fulham: Bettinelli, Hoogland, Burn, Turner, Husband, Parker, Tunnicliffe, Guthrie,(Kacaniklic 68), Kavanagh (Ruiz 68), Smith, McCormack . Subs: Kiraly, Stafylidis, Woodrow, Rodallega, Donnelly. But Charlton hit back with a 16th minute equaliser. Morgan Fox’s cross bounced across the front of goal and Frederic Bulot swung a leg at it but could not connect. . It was left for a waiting Johann Gudmundsson to fire his 10th goal of the season into the top right corner. Goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli, who seemed rooted to the spot, wisely dragged a furious James Husband, who seemed to believe the goal offside, from a confrontation with the linesman. Almost the whole stadium thought Gudmundsson had nabbed his second when Igor Vetokele set him up with the whole goal to aim at but the winger contrived to miss, hitting the side netting instead. The second half was low in quality but high in chances. The visitors seemed reenergised after the interval, forcing a save in the 46th minute. Matt Smith found space in the centre of the box and got his head on a pinpoint James Husband cross but Henderson did well to thwart the effort. Charlton soon asserted control with Tony Watt going close three times before Parker was booked for bringing him down with a late challenge. The Charlton players were outraged when referee Andy Madley awarded Fulham a free kick 25 yards out deep into stoppage time but McCormack blasted the ball over the bar. Joseph Gomez  and Dan Burn fight for the ball during match between Charlton Athletic and Fulham. Fulham now sit 20th in the table eight points clear of fellow London rivals Millwall, but Symons is refusing to relax just yet. He said: ‘We’re definitely not safe until it’s mathematically sure because this league is topsy turvy at both ends and it is going to go to the wire. .

        "doc": "I don't always talk about news events with my daughters, but there was something about the story of ESPN reporter Britt McHenry and the wildly offensive way she spoke to that towing company employee that made me bring it up. One of the main things I preach to my girls, ages 7 and 9, is the importance of respecting other people, no matter who you are and what you go on to accomplish. It's something that my husband and I just do -- we show respect to everyone from a taxi driver to a teacher to the President of the United States. Let me say right here that I have lost my cool from time to time, whether it's been a phone call with a credit card company to complain about late fees or an experience of bad service at a restaurant. In those cases, when I feel like I'm going to pop, I keep saying, \"This is unacceptable, This is unacceptable,\" and either hang up in disgust or storm off. (Not perfect ways of handling these incidents, but at no time would I ever think to insult or demean the other person in these situations.) Some of McHenry's comments, such as how she's \"on television,\" imply that she may have the dangerous thinking that she, by dint of her career, education and income, is better than people who don't get paid what she does or have the same kind of career or educational opportunities. McHenry showed that she either forgot those \"golden rule\" lessons from childhood or that she hasn't really lived her life with that mantra. McHenry has since apologized on Twitter, saying she said \"some insulting and regrettable things,\" and that as frustrated as she was during an experience at a towing company in Virginia,  she should \"always choose to be respectful and take the high road.\" But it's not clear that apology will satisfy anyone who watched the video of her exchange with the towing company worker. \"I see this Britt McHenry video, and think: it's not just about how a celebrity shouldn't act in public, it's how all of us shouldn't act,\" wrote \"Cait\" on Twitter. Said \"Shannon,\" also on Twittter, \"I had no idea who Britt McHenry was before but ... now I know she's the kind of woman I hope I've taught my daughters not to be.\" \"Her language and disdain brings shame on her, her profession, and her employer. People don't all of sudden have such a vile tirade. This comes after years of practice and a pattern of similar behaviors. Let's let her be an example to others,\" wrote C Cooper on a Change.org petition asking McHenry's employers to fire her. The McHenry story seemed to strike a chord in our household because my older daughter asked what was going to happen to her. This morning, I told her McHenry was suspended for a week by ESPN, and that led to another conversation. My kids seemed to get it and many celebrities also seem to remember to \"treat other people the way you would want them to treat you\" even in uncomfortable moments. Celebrity apologies: The good, bad and uncomfortable. So, Britt McHenry, check out these examples of how the rich, famous and powerful handled stressful situations with grace and dignity. After British journalist Katie Hopkins seriously fat-shamed pop music star Kelly Clarkson, saying a host of insulting things about the singer's weight, Clarkson won praise for her graceful response. \"That's because she doesn't know me. I'm awesome. It doesn't bother me. It's a free world. Say what you will. I've just never cared what people think,\" she said. A college baseball player gets suspended for calling Little League baseball phenom Mo'ne Davis a \"slut.\" Her response? She emailed Bloomsburg University asking that the college reinstate him. \"Everyone makes mistakes and everyone deserves a second chance,\" Davis, the first girl to earn a win and to pitch a shutout in Little League World Series history, told ESPN. \"... I know right now he's really hurt and I know how hard he worked to get where he is. I mean, I was pretty hurt on my part but I know he's hurting even more.\" When an Argentinian journalist wrote an open letter to Pope Francis expressing concern about the pontiff meeting with the country's president ahead of the general election in October and possibly influencing the outcome, what did the Pope do? Well, he picked up the phone and gave the journalist a call. Wish we could have been a fly on the wall for that conversation! The pope appears to have been more than graceful, because after the conversation, the journalist pledged to learn how to pray. When Queen Bey faced immense criticism after allegedly lip-synching the national anthem in honor of President Obama's inauguration in 2013, she didn't come out swinging. Instead, she admitted to singing along with her \"pre-recorded track\" at the inauguration but only after she opened her news conference with what was described as a stirring, a cappella rendition of the national anthem. Finally, Reese Witherspoon may be the closest example for McHenry to consider when it comes to overcoming a very offensive episode. When Witherspoon and her husband were pulled over in 2013 for suspicion of driving under the influence, the Academy Award winning actress was recorded making comments to the officer such as, \"Do you know who I am?\" and \"You're about to find out who I am.\" She ultimately issued an apologetic statement, and then went on morning television to apologize some more. \"We went out to dinner in Atlanta, and we had one too many glasses of wine, and we thought we were fine to drive and we absolutely were not,\" she said on \"Good Morning America.\" \"It's completely unacceptable, and we are so sorry and embarrassed. We know better, and we shouldn't have done that.\" And, she added, \"When a police officer tells you to stay in the car, you stay in the car. I learned that for sure,\" she told the GMA host . Now, did McHenry learn that when a towing company worker or anyone else makes you incredibly angry, you never berate them for their weight, job, appearance and income? Let's hope so.

        "doc": "While the fight against ISIS in Syria and Iraq holds the world's gaze, a simultaneous transformation is getting less attention: the deterioration of al Qaeda. In an audio message released Sunday, al Qaeda confirmed that two of its leaders, known as Ustad Ahmad Farooq and Qari Abdullah Mansur, were killed in CIA drone strikes in January in North Waziristan, near the Afghan-Pakistan border. Farooq's real name was Raja Mohammad Suleman, al Qaeda said. He was a Pakistani who acted as the group's liaison to the Pakistan Taliban and was the deputy commander of al Qaeda's South Asia branch. (Mansur's real name was Qari Ubaidullah, a Pakistani who oversaw suicide missions against U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan). Al Qaeda's South Asia branch is relatively new, announced with some fanfare back in September by al Qaeda's top leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri. The creation of the terror group's South Asia branch was seen by some terrorism analysts as an attempt to steal some of the limelight from ISIS, which is embroiled in a public dispute with al Qaeda for leadership of the global jihad movement. The deaths of the two men continue the decimation of al Qaeda's bench of leaders. On Monday, in the southern Pakistani city of Karachi, local al Qaeda commander Nurul Hassan was killed in a raid, said Arif Hanif, district inspector general of police. Florida-raised Adnan Shukrijumah, 39, who was in charge of al Qaeda's operations to attack the West, was killed in December in a Pakistani military operation. Texas-born Mohanad Mahmoud Al Farekh, who also played a planning role for al Qaeda's operations, was arrested in Pakistan last year. The deaths of Ubaidullah and Suleman underline the fact that there are almost no top leaders of al Qaeda left except al-Zawahiri. Both Ubaidullah and Suleman were Pakistani. This is an indicator of how al Qaeda has become a largely Pakistan-focused group, increasingly able to do nothing of any significance outside of Pakistan or Afghanistan. Indeed, al Qaeda has virtually no capacity to carry out attacks in the West. The last successful al Qaeda attack in the West was the London transportation system bombings a decade ago. Al Qaeda is now reduced only to holding American hostages such as 73-year-old aid worker Warren Weinstein, who was kidnapped from his home in the Pakistani city of Lahore on August 13, 2011. To be sure, al Qaeda's Yemen-based affiliate, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, continues to pose a threat to American aviation. The group has built hard-to-detect bombs, which it has placed on U.S.-bound flights. Luckily, those bombs were faulty or were detected. The group also trained one of the gunmen who attacked the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris in January, killing 12, but it's not clear if AQAP had any direct role in planning this attack. Meanwhile, ISIS continues to attract Western recruits and also inspire \"homegrown\" terrorists in the West, but the core al Qaeda organization that killed almost 3,000 men, women and children on 9/11 is on life support. Al Qaeda's confirmation of the deaths of Ubaidullah and Suleman is just one of the latest pieces of evidence for this assessment.",

World No 1 Williams eventually prevailed 4-6 7-6(3) 6-3 against the dogged Italian to take her career record over her to 8-0 but the American was not impressed. The US  were beaten 3-2 as Williams and Alison Riske were thrashed 6-0 6-3 in the doubles rubber by Errani and Flavia Pennetta, meaning they were relegated to World Group II. American tennis star Serena Williams fought back to beat Italian Sara Errani in the Fed Cup play-off on Sunday . Tough weather conditions made it difficult for both players who had to keep on re-tossing their serves . Errani gave Williams a real scare but in the end the world No 1's power proved to be too much . 'Today has been a big eye opener,' Williams said afterwards. 'I'm totally not as ready for the claycourt season as I thought I was. Now I'm in the mindset of, \"You know what, I'm not on hard court.\" I'm playing like I'm on hard court and I'm not. 'So I have to play and be ready to hit a thousand shots if necessary.' Williams, 33, won her 19th singles grand slam at the Australian Open and her dominance has raised talk of her claiming all the majors this year. The French Open has been her least successful of the four though despite claiming the title in Paris in 2002 and 2013. Her doubles defeat on Sunday blotted an otherwise flawless Fed Cup record and left the US facing a battle to get back amongst the elite nations next year. 'We have to work harder,' US captain Mary Joe Fernandez said. 'We came close today and need to just keep plugging away. 'The good news is that we have a lot of players in the top 100 and, hopefully, we can get two wins next year and get back into the World Group.'

Graduate Jacob Phillips, 23, plunged down the cliff when he leapt over a fence in the dark. Mr Phillips had caught the cab home after a night out with friends in December – but didn’t have enough cash to pay for it.

In a startling new tutorial YouTube star Promise Tamang turns herself into Maleficent, Angelina Jolie's character from the  movie of the same name. But where the mother-of-six wore cheek prosthetics to achieve the unnaturally sharp cheekbones, Promise's bone structure is a result of clever contouring. Scroll down for video In a new Youtube tutorial Promise Tamang has turned herself into Maleficent, Angelina Jolie's character from the upcoming movie of the same name This isn't the first time she has transformed herself into a Disney character though. Promise has previously made videos of herself as Elsa from Frozen and Princess Jasmine from Aladdin. When she posted a picture taken from the tutorial to Instagram many of her followers couldn't believe their eyes. One commented: 'this girl is RIDICULOUSLY TALENTED! She can make herself look like anyone with her makeup shading including lips! Crazy.' On the video she reveals her step-by-step process beginning with a thick all-over pale foundation. Over the top of that she sucked in her cheeks to begin the contouring technique made famous by Kim Kardashian. But while the reality star makes sure her maquillage is properly blended, Promise shows how she draws a sharp line diagonally along the length of her cheekbones to create the character's highly chiselled bone structure. In the four minute film Promise takes her followers through the steps to transform herself into Maleficent Here promise is seen heavily contouring her face having applied heavy eyebrows and a pale base To highlight them even more, she added another layer of even paler make-up to the tops of her cheekbones and under her eyes. Next came perfectly applied berry lipstick and long black eyelashes applied with tweezers. The finished result is uncannny as she dons a latex headdress with horns just like Jolie's own in the retelling of the classic Sleeping Beauty fairy tale.

        "doc": "(CNN)ESPN's Britt McHenry this week found herself in the news, rather than reporting on it, after a video surfaced showing her berating and belittling an employee of a tow company in Arlington, Virginia. Among the highlights, as caught on tape and eventually uploaded to LiveLeak: \"I'm on television and you're in a f**king trailer, honey,\" and \"I wouldn't work at a scumbag place like this. Makes my skin crawl even being here.\" And, finally, \"Lose some weight, baby girl.\" It's pretty cringe-worthy stuff that seems difficult, if not impossible, to defend. McHenry quickly issued an apology, blaming the incident on a moment of intense frustration but admitting her mistake and accepting responsibility. It was, however, too late: the #firebrittmchenry hashtag was already trending on Twitter, where she was called everything from classist, class-less, and \"ugly on the inside\" to a \"sad, self-hating coward.\" ESPN, meanwhile, announced that McHenry would be suspended for a week. Certainly McHenry should have known better than to have used such words, even if that's what she was thinking, least of all because in our YouTube age, such missteps always come to light. But while McHenry's reaction could very well have been a result of an overblown sense of entitlement, evidence of a mean girl who never left high school, what's also troubling is how quickly and gleefully the rest of us issued blame on McHenry without fully knowing -- or, it seems, caring about -- the other side of the story. The video that was released -- by the tow company -- was heavily edited and included only McHenry's responses, not the comments of the employee who may have provoked her and contributed to an argument that clearly escalates as the video goes on. McHenry knew she was being taped; at one point, she looks directly at the camera. The employee even threatens to make the video public. Did McHenry keep going because she has that much of a self-destructive streak? Or because she truly could not help herself? Or was she confident that any video evidence would show that there were two people playing this particular game? How Britt McHenry could have responded These days, there's nothing we love more than an example of a celebrity fall from grace, whether it's Lindsay Lohan or Brian Williams or Britt McHenry, who was judged not on the facts but on what we take particular joy in believing: that the over-privileged and semi-famous do not necessarily deserve a fair trial. The high price of public shaming online Sure, McHenry probably feels entitled, but that's our doing, too. We're a society obsessed with putting celebrities on a pedestal -- celebrating them, compensating them. And yet when, in a moment of frustration and stress, McHenry lets the entitlement bestowed on her win out over taking a deep breath and walking away, we're right there to demand to know what gives her the nerve. You know what gives her the nerve? We do. (Be honest: When is the last time you had a warm and fuzzy experience at the tow lot?) But we're really no better than she is. The problem with social media, and our dependence on it, is that it allows people to present and receive whatever angle they want, biased or not, fair or not. It's the \"power of the press\" without the objectivity or accountability demanded of the actual press. And it has enabled a dangerous vigilantism that makes those who use that power no different from the ones they are supposedly rallying against. Think about it. Who was worse: McHenry or the people who made that video public, and who did so without owning up to their part in the conversation? Who is worse: Britt McHenry for childishly mocking a confrontational tow employee's bad teeth, or the Twitter masses who call for justice and \"the return of class\" -- who express views like, \"Part of me feels bad for Britt McHenry. Poor thing actually believes she was hired for 'brains' and 'education'? Shouldn't they question whether, in fact, McHenry could have actually been standing up for herself? Sorry to break it to you, but these days, we're all bullies. At least Britt McHenry owns up to it.",

            "(CNN)ESPN's Britt McHenry this week found herself in the news, rather than reporting on it, after a video surfaced showing her berating and belittling an employee of a tow company in Arlington, Virginia. Among the highlights, as caught on tape and eventually uploaded to LiveLeak: \"I'm on television and you're in a f**king trailer, honey,\" and \"I wouldn't work at a scumbag place like this. Makes my skin crawl even being here.\" And, finally, \"Lose some weight, baby girl.\" It's pretty",
            "Makes my skin crawl even being here.\" And, finally, \"Lose some weight, baby girl.\" It's pretty cringe-worthy stuff that seems difficult, if not impossible, to defend. McHenry quickly issued an apology, blaming the incident on a moment of intense frustration but admitting her mistake and accepting responsibility. It was, however, too late: the #firebrittmchenry hashtag was already trending on Twitter, where she was called everything from classist, class-less, and \"ugly on the inside\" to a \"sad,",
            "where she was called everything from classist, class-less, and \"ugly on the inside\" to a \"sad, self-hating coward.\" ESPN, meanwhile, announced that McHenry would be suspended for a week. Certainly McHenry should have known better than to have used such words, even if that's what she was thinking, least of all because in our YouTube age, such missteps always come to light. But while McHenry's reaction could very well have been a result of an overblown sense of entitlement, evidence of a mean",
            "could very well have been a result of an overblown sense of entitlement, evidence of a mean girl who never left high school, what's also troubling is how quickly and gleefully the rest of us issued blame on McHenry without fully knowing -- or, it seems, caring about -- the other side of the story. The video that was released -- by the tow company -- was heavily edited and included only McHenry's responses, not the comments of the employee who may have provoked her and contributed to an argument",
            "not the comments of the employee who may have provoked her and contributed to an argument that clearly escalates as the video goes on. McHenry knew she was being taped; at one point, she looks directly at the camera. The employee even threatens to make the video public. Did McHenry keep going because she has that much of a self-destructive streak? Or because she truly could not help herself? Or was she confident that any video evidence would show that there were two people playing this",
            "Or was she confident that any video evidence would show that there were two people playing this particular game? How Britt McHenry could have responded These days, there's nothing we love more than an example of a celebrity fall from grace, whether it's Lindsay Lohan or Brian Williams or Britt McHenry, who was judged not on the facts but on what we take particular joy in believing: that the over-privileged and semi-famous do not necessarily deserve a fair trial. The high price of public shaming",
            "and semi-famous do not necessarily deserve a fair trial. The high price of public shaming online Sure, McHenry probably feels entitled, but that's our doing, too. We're a society obsessed with putting celebrities on a pedestal -- celebrating them, compensating them. And yet when, in a moment of frustration and stress, McHenry lets the entitlement bestowed on her win out over taking a deep breath and walking away, we're right there to demand to know what gives her the nerve. You know what gives",
            "and walking away, we're right there to demand to know what gives her the nerve. You know what gives her the nerve? We do. (Be honest: When is the last time you had a warm and fuzzy experience at the tow lot?) But we're really no better than she is.

        "doc": "(CNN)\"A long, long, time ago...\" Those five words, when uttered or sung, makes baby boomers immediately think of Don McLean's pop masterpiece \"American Pie.\"  It's hard to believe that his phenomenal 8½ minute allegory, which millions of Americans know by heart, is 44 years old.  All sorts of historical cross-currents play off each other in this timeless song, brilliantly gilded with the unforgettable chorus, which starts as \"Bye, Bye, Miss American Pie.\" There is no real way to categorize McLean's \"American Pie\" for its hybrid of modern poetry and folk ballad, beer-hall chant and high-art rock. On Tuesday, Christie's sold the 16-page handwritten manuscript of the song's lyrics for $1.2 million to an unnamed buyer. McLean was a paperboy when, on February 3, 1959, he saw that Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and J.P. \"The Big Bopper\" Richardson had been tragically killed in an airplane crash in Clear Lake, Iowa. \"The next day I went to school in shock and guess what?\" McLean recalled.  \"Nobody cared.  Rock 'n' roll in those days was sort of like hula hoops and Buddy hadn't had a big hit on the charts since '57.\"  By cathartically writing \"American Pie,\" McLean has guaranteed that the memory of those great musicians lives forever. Having recorded his first album, \"Tapestry,\" in 1969, in Berkeley, California, during the student riots, McLean, a native New Yorker, became a kind of weather vane for what he called the \"generation lost in space.\"   When his cultural anthem \"American Pie\" was released in November 1971, it replaced Bob Dylan's \"The Times They Are A Changin\" as the Peoples Almanac of the new decade.  It's important to think of \"American Pie\" as one would of Henry Longfellow's \"Evangeline\" or Johnny Mercer's \"Moon River\" -- an essential Americana poem emanating wistful recollection, blues valentine, and youthful protest rolled into one.  There is magic brewing in the music and words of \"American Pie,\" for McLean's lyrics and melody frame a cosmic dream, like those Jack Kerouac tried to conjure in his poetry-infused novel \"On the Road.\" Don McLean: Buddy Holly, rest in peace Influenced by Pete Seeger and the Weavers, McLean proudly wore the mantle of troubadour in the early 1970s, when \"American Pie\" topped the Billboard charts, and has never shed the cape.   Wandering far and wide, singing \"American Pie\" at windblown dance halls in Wyoming and cloistered colleges in New England, at huge amphitheaters in California and little coffee houses in the Hudson River Valley, McLean has performed his global anthem thousands of times.  Yet the encore number never loses its transfixing allure. When McLean prods audiences by rhapsodizing \"and they were singing\" everybody spontaneously joins in with the \"Bye, Bye\" chorus.  Watching McLean deliver his most notable song in concert is to take part in a collective Happening. What makes \"American Pie\" so unusual is that it isn't a relic from the counterculture but a talisman, which, like a sacred river, keeps bringing joy to listeners everywhere.  When \"American Pie\" suddenly is played on a jukebox or radio it's almost impossible not to sing along.   Like \"Danny Boy\" or \"Streets of Laredo\" or \"Shenandoah,\" it's eternal.  With illusions to football fields and rock 'n' roll, river levees and nursery rhymes, the song cascades along like a boat going down Niagara Falls or a roller coaster that jumps tracks but floats instead of crashes. After all these years, \"American Pie\" still makes me feel empowered and yet filled with a sense of loss.  The song is alive and joyful, yet fretful about a world gone wrong.  It is a song that will never die.  A reverie for the ages.   There is a jump to the chorus, which forces the mind to relive the '50s, '60s and '70s, to troll through the back pages of our lives while, like a traditional Irish folksong, it reminds us of fate. While McLean, the muse, has rightfully not tried to interpret \"American Pie,\" it's fair to surmise that \"the king\" is Elvis Presley, \"Helter Skelter\" refers to the Charles Manson murders, the \"jester on the sidelines in a cast\" is Bob Dylan, and \"Jack Flash\" the Rolling Stones.  But who knows?  The lyric remains a puzzle open to thousands of spirited interpretations.  As a literary artifact of the early 1970s, there isn't anything to compare to \"American Pie.\" Normally, I don't like rankings of literature or songs or even presidents, for that matter.  But the fact that the Recording Industry of America and the National Endowment of the Arts chose \"American Pie\" as the fifth greatest song of the 20th century speaks to the composition's importance as an enduring piece of pop art.  The other four were \"Over the Rainbow\" (by Harold Arlen and E.Y \"Yip\" Harburg), \"White Christmas \"(by Irving Berlin), \"This Land is Your Land\" (by Woody Guthrie) and \"Respect\" (by Otis Redding).  That is fine company. Quite simply, \"American Pie\" is one of the greatest songs ever written.  And Tuesday the original lyrics found a new home.",

        "doc": "Jonjo O'Neill hosted a media stable visit on Thursday at his Jackdaws Castle yard in Gloucestershire and said he could not be happier with favourite for the Crabbie's Grand National, Shutthefrontdoor. He trains Shutthefrontdoor for his principal patron J P McManus, who owns Jackdaws Castle and retains AP McCoy, the record-breaking Jump jockey who is about to gain his 20th consecutive jockeys' championship and retire. McCoy has not decided yet whether he is riding Shutthefrontdoor in the £1million Crabbie's Grand National at Aintree on  April 11, but everything points to him doing so. Jonjo O'Neill hopes jockey AP McCoy rides Shutthefrontdoor to Grand National success later this month O'Neill told Betfred: 'Shutthefrontdoor is in great form. I could not be happier with him. I would have liked to have got a run into him (before the Grand National) but he had an abscess on his sinus in January/February time which took a while to find out where it was. 'We did think about giving him at run at Cheltenham (at the Festival in March) but decided not to. I think he is a better horse on a flat track and secondly I did not want to give him a hard race at a time when he wasn't as well as he is now. He is schooling well and is spot on. 'He is a clean-winded horse, who is not hard to get ready. He was ready to run and win first time out at Carlisle. He is going to Aintree fresh and well. It is all down to AP now if he is going ride him. 'You need to have a good classy horse for the National. Before, you needed a good jumper and a lot of luck, now it is a proper race. Aintree has done a great job with the track and the fences are first class. 'He likes to be up there and hopefully in the first half of the runners - that at least is my plan. If he got luck in running over the first mile, I would ride him myself. 'I don't bet so it does not make any difference to me what price he is - I am just training the horse as though he was going for a little race at Stratford or whatever! This year's Grand National will be McCoy's last-ever at Aintree before his retirement at the end of the season 'Hopefully, AP is going to ride Shutthefrontdoor and the public will want to back him, looking for a fairytale story. We would all love that to happen, but it is a tall order. 'The only pressure (on me) is that Shutthefrontdoor gets there safe and sound. He is in the best form I can possibly get him. I would be more nervous if we had hiccups now but we had them in January and February. If he doesn't win, we can blame whoever rides him! 'I'd love good ground at Aintree - he is a well-balanced horse and a great mover. He does not want it too soft. Perfect jumping ground is ideal. They make a good job of the ground at Aintree - we just don't want the heavens to open. He is as good as any horse in the National. 'We are going there full of confidence, but you have got to be realistic - it is the National.' Don't Push It gave O'Neill, McManus and McCoy their first Grand National victory in 2010. O'Neill continued: 'This preparation has gone better than Don't Push It's. Don't Push It was a bit of a law unto himself. Alan Berry has done all the work with this horse, like he did with Don't Push It. We think we have got it all right and are very happy with the way things have gone. Shutthefrontdoor, pictured with O'Neill (right) is the favourite for the race on April 11 'Shutthefrontdoor is a lovely horse - a real old pet - and loves racing, while the other horse was half-mad, a character. 'He lacks experience as a jumper but I think he is quite clever, pretty accurate and knows what he is doing. If he does take to the fences, he will run a blinder. 'I have taken him away (to racecourses) a couple of times so he is not too fresh. I don't want him to be too fresh over the first couple of fences. I used to build three or four National fences every year but one year we didn't and that was the year Don't Push It won so we haven't since. The Grand National fences are now really inviting. 'The Grand National grips you and is magic to be involved in. 'We will miss AP not riding in races next season but hopefully he is still going to be involved. We are not going to let him off the hook that easily - we may drag him in for schooling.' O'Neill envisages a team of between eight and 12 running at Aintree during the three days of the Crabbie's Grand National Festival (April 9 - 11). 'Holywell will run in the Betfred Bowl (April 9) after a great run (fourth) in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. He was beaten fair and square - the ground went against us a bit. He put a lot of effort into his jumping and did not quite get home. 'He came out of the race a bit tired for the first week to 10 days but is absolutely flying now and did a lovely bit of work yesterday [Wednesday] morning. He came alive there last year and seems to like the track.'",

        "doc": "Hector Bellerin is fast becoming seen by fans, and possibly even by his manager, as Arsenal's premier right back, after impressing in the absence of Mathieu Debuchy. The young Spaniard scored his second Premier League goal, cutting inside and curling left-footed past Simon Mignolet, in the 4-1 win over Liverpool last weekend, and is developing a reputation as a player capable of becoming a top-level full back. But, it seems, in the dressing room, it is his status as the club's premier sprinter, rather than as a defender, that is most in question, after he beat Theo Walcott's 40 metre club sprint record last summer. Hector Bellerin scored a brilliant goal to put Arsenal ahead against Liverpool last weekend at the Emirates. Bellerin has emerged as a star player after filling in for the injured Mathieu Debuchy at right back this season. 'We were just having a test and then they told me I was the fastest at the club,' Bellerin told The Telegraph. 'I did not beat it by that much. There was a bit of banter and he is trying to beat me now.' Bellerin shaved a hundredth of a second off Walcott's time, prompting the 26-year-old winger to vow to reclaim his title at the end of the season. . And since then he has gone on to establish himself as a right-back of some promise, progressing well beyond Arsene Wenger's expectations.  . 'I am happy that now, after not so good performances in the beginning, the coach has still put confidence in me and given me minutes. . Bellerin has exceptional pace, as he proved in August when he set a new Arsenal record over 40 metres. Theo Walcott had previously held the record, but Bellerin shaved one hundredth of a second off his time. But Walcott is determined to take his record back from Bellerin this summer and be speed king again. 'The chances always come through injuries, which is not a nice thing. Now we are going to have Debuchy back and I am happy for him, but when you get your chance, you need to do the best you can. I have done my best to take this opportunity.' With Debuchy on the verge of match fitness, Bellerin will soon find out whether he has done enough to grab that opportunity. .

        "doc": "On Thursday, NPR -- headquartered in Washington, just 40 miles away from Baltimore -- ran its latest update on the urban turmoil that has erupted in the wake of the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray because of still-unexplained spinal injuries that occurred while he was under police custody. Unfortunately, while it was a freshly produced segment, it was hardly a new story. Titled \"Baltimore Unrest Reveals Tensions Between African-Americans And Asians,\" the five-minute piece is urgently introduced with the promise that it will reveal \"what's really happening in the more troubled neighborhoods of this majority black city,\" going on state that a key ingredient of the unrest was African-Americans \"targeting Asian-owned businesses for destruction.\" A similar claim was made after Ferguson's uprising in August of last year. Indeed, it has been a toxic feature of the coverage of many episodes of mass metropolitan violence since the late 1980s, the era during which the trope of widespread hostility between Asian and black communities first took root in the media consciousness. Yes, interethnic tensions continue to exist, though they are hardly limited to Asians and blacks. And yes, this has resulted in troubling incidents and tragedies on both sides. But while reports say that during the chaotic social breakdowns of the past year, black-owned businesses were mostly protected during bouts of violence, there's little evidence to suggest a pattern in which Asian businesses have been actively targeted out of racial animus. Instead, it seems as if Asian-owned stores have experienced damage partly because they make up a portion of establishments operating in the most economically vulnerable and socially volatile of neighborhoods. In other words, they were collateral damage, along with other stores in the vicinity of riots. So it's time to call this persistent meme what it is: A misleading, hyperbolic and dangerous distraction, one that shifts blame away from the real issues. As Jennifer Lee, sociology professor at University of California, Irvine, and author of the 2002 book \"Civility in the City: Blacks, Jews and Koreans in Urban America,\" notes, \"the mainstream media continues to pit minority groups against one another to draw attention from larger structural problems that plague poor, disadvantaged communities. By directing our attention to interminority conflict, it directs blame away from the structures that perpetuate gross inequality and toward individual problems.\" Let's be honest. There were then -- and still are -- legitimate issues that exist between immigrant storeowners and the largely African American customers they serve that are rooted in extensive cultural differences. There's no denying that friction exists in the daily transaction between embattled communities trying hard to coexist under economic and social pressures. For example, in 1993, the robbery and shooting of Joel Lee, a 21-year-old Korean American at Towson State University, and the subsequent acquittal of his killer, was a point of contention between the Korean and African American communities. But things are different now. Decades after the height of media-inflamed tension between Asian and African Americans, patterns of immigration have shifted. Stores once operated by recent Korean immigrants are now owned by strivers from South Asia, the Middle East and Africa. The population of Baltimore has shrunk and its economy has contracted. Among merchants, there's ever-greater recognition that they and their customers are tied by a red thread, surviving or failing together. For decades, black and Asian advocacy groups have been trying to bridge differences between the communities. For example, the Baltimore-based Korean-American Grocers & Licensed Beverage Association of Maryland, founded in 1995, has worked to support its entrepreneurial members in their own attempts to address longstanding issues of neglect and abuse by Baltimore's police, while also encouraging them to build deeper ties with their constituents. A KAGRO-sponsored annual scholarship program has given hundreds of thousands of dollars in college grants to children growing up in the Baltimore neighborhoods their member retailers serve. These aren't the kind of stories you'll hear in the media. It's easier to focus on attention-grabbing anecdotes rather than the long, hard work of adjustment and accommodation going on within and around communities. Back in 1995, the Baltimore Sun profiled Soon Jae and Eun Ja Lee, owners of Lee's Food Market in the West Baltimore's Sandtown neighborhood -- the same part of the city that NPR called out as a locus of Asian-black tension. The story highlighted the Lees' openness to the community, their politeness and care for their customers and their outstanding generosity, which includes both free snacks to schoolchildren and the distribution of tens of thousands of free food baskets to needy local families each year. I spoke with Eun Ja Lee, calling her without warning to check on the status of the Lees' four-decade-old business after the violence of Monday and Tuesday. Were they open? Were they safe? \"Oh, of course we're open, we're always open!\" said Mrs. Lee, warmly and brightly. \"This week, many customers came in and said to me 'Mrs. Lee, don't worry you are part of our community, you are our family. We will make sure you are OK -- just stay open!' We love it. We love it.\" And yet, no one has come and interviewed her at their untouched and fully operational family market, nor have they talked with her customers, stoutly loyal after 37 years of patronage. Reinforcing the tired narrative of black-Asian interracial tension generates heat, but not light. There's a far more complex and nuanced relationship between these two urban populations, one that is in an ongoing state of evolution -- and it deserves to be told, not buried under cliches and clickbait.",

            "For decades, black and Asian advocacy groups have been trying to bridge differences between the communities. For example, the Baltimore-based Korean-American Grocers & Licensed Beverage Association of Maryland, founded in 1995, has worked to support its entrepreneurial members in their own attempts to address longstanding issues of neglect and abuse by Baltimore's police, while also encouraging them to build deeper ties with their constituents.

A KAGRO-sponsored annual scholarship program has given hundreds of thousands of dollars in college grants to children growing up in the Baltimore neighborhoods their member retailers serve.

            "and accommodation going on within and around communities. Back in 1995, the Baltimore Sun profiled Soon Jae and Eun Ja Lee, owners of Lee's Food Market in the West Baltimore's Sandtown neighborhood -- the same part of the city that NPR called out as a locus of Asian-black tension.

There's a far more complex and nuanced relationship between these two urban populations, one that is in an ongoing state of evolution -- and it deserves to be told, not buried under cliches and clickbait."

        "doc": "Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of Premier League fixtures, as well as intriguing statistics from the Football League. . 1. Dick Advocaat might consider bringing in referee Anthony Taylor to give his players some lessons on keeping up with play. The official sprinted more than half the length of the field to be 10 yards from Yannick Bolasie when he completed his hat-trick for Crystal Palace in the 4-1 demolition of Sunderland. Top marks for him – but none at all for Lee Cattermole who was goal side of Bolasie before the breakaway began, yet way behind the official when the goal went in. Connor Wickham and Adam Johnson were also both stood nearer their own goal than the ref when James McArthur’s clearance began the move, but nowhere to be seen when the ball hit the net. Yannick Bolasie raced past Lee Cattermole before scoring his hat-trick goal against Sunderland . Cattermole was goal side of Bolasie before the Crystal Palace winger went on to score his third goal. Referee Anthony Taylor sprinted past Sunderland midfielder Cattermole during Bolasie's impessive run. Bolasie starred in Crystal Palace's emphatic 4-1 win over Sunderland at the Stadium of Light . 2. Gary Cahill has responded to the challenge of fighting Kurt Zouma for his place in Chelsea’s defence and looks to be winning the battle. When it got tough for the Premier League leaders at Loftus Road it was Cahill who responded best to ensure Cesc Fabregas’ late striker was a winner. Cahill made 15 clearances – as many as the rest of Chelsea’s back four put together – and won 13 of 15 duels for the ball. Gary Cahill has managed to win back his starting spot alongside John Terry after his brief absence . Chelsea starlet Kurt Zouma had deputised for Cahill during the England international's stint on the sidelines . 3. Arsene Wenger’s decision to axe goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny after fining him for smoking in the showers at Southampton has proved a pivotal point of Arsenal’s season. The 1-0 victory at Burnley was the sixth clean sheet the Gunners had kept in 12 Premier League games since David Ospina took over – one more than they’d achieved in the previous 20. More important, Arsenal have won 11 of those matches to move from sixth in the table to second. Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina has kept six clean sheets since replacing Wojciech Szczesny . 4. Vincent Kompany’s recovery from a hamstring injury was supposed to be the boost Manchester City needed towards the end of the season but instead has marked the collapse of their campaign. City were in the middle of a 14-game unbeaten run when their skipper came back to face title rivals Arsenal at the end of January – a game they lost 2-0. The 4-2 collapse at Old Trafford made it 14 matches since then, of which City have lost eight. Belgian star Kompany has missed only one of them – a 2-0 win over Leicester which saw one of only three clean sheets. Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany has struggled for form during the past few weeks . 5. West Brom’s 'Jeff Astle day' provided a nostalgic trip back in time, with Albion’s players wearing replica kit from the 1968 FA Cup final and shirts numbered from two to 11 (goalkeeper Boaz Myhill wore no number, like John Osborne back then). But there was one aspect that was completely out of keeping with the flashback to football’s black and white days – every one of Albion’s players wore coloured boots. Four red pairs, two orange, two white, one blue, one yellow – and captain Darren Fletcher’s purplish pinky colour made up the modern footwear rainbow. West Brom captain Darren Fletcher wore multicoloured boots on 'Jeff Astle day' at The Hawthorns. 6. When Paul Lambert was sacked in early February, Aston Villa had scored just 15 goals in 28 matches in all competitions. It’s taken Tim Sherwood just 10 games to overtake that total – Christian Benteke’s winner at White Hart Lane was the 16th scored since his appointment. Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke has returned to form since Tim Sherwood's arrival at Villa Park. 7. James Ward-Prowse backed up manager Ronald Koeman’s faith by tucking away the penalty against Hull that put Southampton on the path to a 2-0 win. Koeman had to shout orders from the bench to let the England youngster take the kick as Senegalese striker Sadio Mane picked up the ball to head for the spot first. You couldn’t blame Mane for wanting to jump the queue – Ward-Prowse had never scored a Premier League goal in 68 previous appearances for the Saints, and none of his four England Under 21 strikes had come from the penalty spot. Southampton manager Ronald Koeman ensured James Ward-Prowse took penalty ahead of Sadio Mane . 8. Reading midfielder Jem Karacan has timed his return to fitness perfectly after 16 horrible months recovering from a cruciate knee ligament operation. The London-born product of the Royals’ youth academy got through 73 minutes of the 0-0 draw with Blackburn in his first start for 16 months – just in time to be available for Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal. He has a good chance of playing at Wembley after helping make the defence more solid. It was the first time Steve Clarke’s side had kept a clean sheet in their last nine Championship games. Reading's Jem Karacan made his first start for 16 months against Blackburn on Saturday afternoon. 9. Taking 50 points is normally a guarantee of safety from relegation in League One – it’s been enough to stay up for all but one of the last nine years (Gillingham had 50 but went down on goal difference in 2010) This season looks like being different, though, after Crewe’s draw with Leyton Orient left both clubs plus Crawley on 47 points with four games still to play. That means sleepless nights for Crawley boss Dean Saunders who’ll have bad memories of going down from the Championship with Wolves despite finishing on 51 points. Crawley Town are in danger of dropping down to League Two despite ascertaining 47 points in 41 games . 10. Plymouth midfielder Bobby Reid has the curious middle name of Armani – and he’s certainly all the fashion when it comes to taking set-pieces. The 22-year-old is on his third loan of the season from Bristol City because Pilgrims boss John Sheridan admires his pinpoint accuracy with a dead ball. He showed why by setting up goals from both a corner and free-kick in a 2-1 win over Mansfield that put Plymouth back into the League Two play-off places. Plymouth midfielder Bobby Reid has taken League Two by storm since being loaned out by Bristol City.  .",

Paddy Power -- well-known for its use of publicity stunts -- used it to link to a piece showing statistics for games between Liverpool and Newcastle United ahead of their English Premier League match on Monday. A Paddy Power spokesman told CNN before Liverpool's 2-0 victory at Anfield: \"It was a joke, and no offense was meant.\" The tweet has since been deleted, but its removal -- along with the statement -- did little to placate social media users who condemned the organization, with some calling for the person who wrote the tweet to be sacked.

        "doc": "Bayern Munich cruised to a 6-1 victory against Champion's League rivals Porto last night. . But not all eyes were on the pitch for the whole 90 minutes, as the German club's manager Pep Guardiola broke the highly dramatic atmosphere with a moment of sartorial comedy. To put it bluntly, he split his pants. A flash of upper thigh and navy boxers made themselves known as he strode up and down the touchline shouting commands at his players. . SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sartorial slip-up: Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola runs through tactics with his players, while ignoring the draft that has emerged at the top of his left leg . A hint of navy: Guardiola's tight-fitting trousers before the tear (left) and after the rip (right) during Bayern Munich's 6-1 victory over Porto. The Spanish tactician, who teamed his tight, grey suit with a navy pullover, black tie and crisp white shirt, joked after the clash: 'I'll have to buy new ones for the next match.' . Guardiola wouldn't be the only famous face guilty of stepping into a suit that is a little on the snug side. The current trend for wearing a whistle and flute that is at least a size too small, presumably to showcase a well-honed physique, has seen plenty of stars sail a little close to the wardrobe malfunction wind. So, who's guilty of worshipping at the altar of super-tight slacks? . Russell Brand. Guilty. Dermot O'Leary. Guilty. Olly Murs. In danger of restricting the blood flow. . Yes, it's officially a wardrobe malfunction...but has Guardiola simply fallen foul of wearing a suit that is a little on the snug side? Blame 007: Daniel Craig wore a close-fitting Tom Ford suit in 2012 Bond movie Skyfall...and thousands of men followed the trend. And breathe! If Beckham gets the snug look just right, his fellow Essex boys, including Jeff Brazier (pictured right) are guilty of going a little too tight. The rock star's take on the whistle and flute: Harry Styles doesn't bother with a jacket but his trousers are certainly skinny, while Russell Brand goes for a second (snake)skin with his casual version of the suit. King of the second skin! Dermot O'Leary rarely wears a suit that could be described as roomy. The trend for a tighter fit has emerged in recent years with 'skinny', 'slim' and 'heritage' fits all offering a snugger-looking silhouette. Cast an eye back three years and the most recent incarnation of James Bond, in Sam Mendes' 2012 movie Skyfall, was seen wearing the kind of form-fitting suit that makes you wonder how it might have been possible to wear it AND brawl on top of a train while hurtling through Turkey. . Throughout the film, an unruffled Daniel Craig sported a grey, tailored suit by Tom Ford which may have been the catalyst for other celebrities wearing a similar look. During his just-ended eight-year reign on The X Factor, Dermot O'Leary's suits have got progressively smaller, seeing him once forced to reach for a safety pin moments before presenting the live show. O'Leary said at the time: 'I remember having a wardrobe malfunction on The X Factor. . 'I had this tight-fitting Alexander McQueen suit and felt the trousers rip…from pole to pole, shall we say. I just had to skilfully apply a safety pin and hope for the best. It was terrifying.' . High street menswear retailer Hawes & Curtis told FEMAIL that figure-hugging clothes are no longer just for women. Not much room to give! Olly Murs, who split his trousers on stage in Sheffield in 2012, sails close to the wind again here while performing at the V Festival in 2013. A thigh-ful! Towie stars Dan Osborne and Joey Essex are both partial to leaving little to the imagination when it comes to formal wear . Edward Smith, head of brand for the company said: 'The skinny look has taken over everyone's wardrobe, regardless of gender. 'Men have been wearing tight T-shirts and shirts for a while now - our best-selling shirt is now an extra slim one.  . 'Remember, men don't want to look great at the weekend and then put on a baggy old suit for the working week. The office is just as much their chance to shine, so suits have had to go through a skinny transformation as much as any other garment.' . Other stars who've fallen foul of their own outfits exposing them include fellow X Factor presenter Olly Murs, whose penchant for clothes that show off his best assets saw his trousers split as he performed on stage at Sheffield Arena in 2012. . Wearing a matching burgundy waistcoat and pants, the star was dancing on his knees when the fabric covering his undercarriage gave way revealing sparkling white pants. For more examples, you only have to wander to the streets of Chelsea or Essex, as the reality television stars who grace our screens on The Only Way is Essex and Made in Chelsea don't appear to own a more roomy suit between them. . Towie star Dan Osborne is clearly proud of his buff body and regularly showcases it in slimline attire and Joey Essex is also partial to a tight pair of strides. While David Beckham rarely gets it wrong these days when it comes to fashion, he is definitely also a fan of a tight suit, and arguably carries it off to perfection. . What do the fashionistas make of the super-snug suit? Fashion blogger Simon Glazin isn't convinced by the current trend. He told FEMAIL: 'Over the last couple of years, terms like 'super skinny' and 'ultra skinny' have been adopted by menswear retailers when it comes to suiting, and to be quite honest, they scare me.' 'There's the circulation-restricting connotations the words 'ultra skinny' bring with them but also the simple truth that a too-tight suit can be quite hideous to look at.' Men are in danger of going for a debonair look but can end up revealing way too much, he adds. . 'You don't want to show the world everything you've got! . 'Some things should remain, erm, under wraps. You find bigger men stuffing themselves into these skinny suits, and the results are disastrous. 'As male models get thinner, so do suit cuts, but this is NOT representative of this country. Us men with 'real' bodies need suits that don't feel restricting. And don't restrict blood flow.' Who should you go for if you want comfort and style? 'Designer labels such as Versace and Salvatore Ferragamo offer suits that have a bit of breathing room.' Let's hope Pep, Dermot and Olly are reading.  .",

But not all eyes were on the pitch for the whole 90 minutes, as the German club's manager Pep Guardiola broke the highly dramatic atmosphere with a moment of sartorial comedy.

        "doc": "It was another momentous night in Barcelona's proud European history, Neymar and Luis Suarez rampaging through Paris Saint-Germain's defence to put one foot in the Champions League semi-finals. And Barcelona's second of the night, in the 67th minute when Suarez stormed through, nutmegged David Luiz and finished, was their 400th goal in the competition. The landmark has been achieved in 202 matches since 1992 when the European Champions Clubs' Cup became the modern Champions League we know and love. The two goals scored by Luis Suarez against PSG took Barcelona past 400 Champions League goals. Barcelona have reached the landmark in 202 Champions League matches since 1992. Barcelona won the quarter-final, first-leg match 3-1 to put themselves in control of the tie. Barcelona still have a little way to go before they catch Real Madrid's 436 Champions League goals. Table courtesy of Opta. However, Barcelona still have a some way to go to match the 436 goals scored in the competition by their great rivals Real Madrid. The Spanish giants are way out on top in the club scoring charts, with Bayern Munich coming in third with 349 goals and Manchester United fourth with 343. Over the Champions League years, Barcelona have found the net most against AC Milan (22), followed by Celtic and Chelsea on 18 apiece. They have scored 17 times against United, Arsenal and Bayer Leverkusen. And it will come as little surprise that Argentine superstar Lionel Messi is way out in front in the breakdown of Barcelona Champions League scorers with 75, the joint-most in the tournament with Cristiano Ronaldo. Brazilian star Rivaldo comes in second with 22 goals, followed by Patrick Kluivert (20), Luis Enrique (19) and Samuel Eto'o (16). To mark Barcelona passing 400 Champions League goals, we take a look at some of the highlights. Barcelona 4 Manchester United 0 (1994-95 group stage) A United side hampered by a limit on foreign players had the misfortune to encounter Johan Cruyff's Barcelona 'Dream Team' at the wrong time. . Hristo Stoichkov and Romario ran United's makeshift defence ragged in front of 114,000 fans, with the Bulgarian scoring twice and the Brazilian once before Albert Ferrer completed United's humiliation. Romario fires home Barcelona's second goal in their 1994 rout of Manchester United in the Nou Camp. Barcelona 5 Chelsea 1 (1999-2000 quarter-final, second leg) Leading 3-1 from the first leg at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea fancied their chances of getting through ahead of the return. . Rivaldo's deflected free-kick and Luis Figo's goal had erased the deficit by half-time, though Tore Andre Flo put Chelsea back in the box seat. . They were seven minutes from going through when Dani Garcia made it 3-1 and there was still time for Rivaldo to miss a penalty. Chelsea's defence crumbled in extra-time, another penalty, this time converted by Rivaldo, and a fifth from Patrick Kluivert carried Barcelona through. . Luis Figo curls the ball home during Barcelona's 5-1 win over Chelsea in 2000. Barcelona 2 Arsenal 1 (2006 final in Paris) The Champions League triumph that signalled the beginning of Barcelona's golden age. . They needed two goals in the last 14 minutes to overcome the stubborn resistance of Arsenal, who had been reduced to 10 men when Jens Lehmann brought down Samuel Eto'o just 18 minutes in. . The Gunners sensationally took the lead through Sol Campbell's thumping header eight minutes before half-time but couldn't hold out as Eto'o and Juliano Belletti sunk them late on. . Captain Carles Puyol lifts the trophy with Ronaldinho after Barcelona's 2006 win over Arsenal. Barcelona 4 Bayern Munich 0 (2008-09 quarter-final, first leg) Pep Guardiola's star-studded team showed their Champions League-winning potential with this demolition of Bayern in which all four goals came before half-time. In no mood to hang around, Lionel Messi opened the scoring after nine minutes and Eto'o added another three minutes later. A second from Messi and another from Thierry Henry essentially settled the two-legged contest before half-time. Thierry Henry salutes Samuel Eto'o after rounding off Barcelona's 4-0 rout of Bayern Munich in 2009. Barcelona 2 Manchester United 0 (2009 final in Rome) Sir Alex Ferguson's team were going for their second Champions League triumph in a row and had beaten Barcelona in the 2008 semi-finals. . Guardiola's team had other ideas and exacted revenge thanks to a 10th-minute opener from Eto'o and Messi's clincher 20 minutes from time. It was Barcelona's midfield partnership of Xavi and Andres Iniesta that ran the game. . Lionel Messi (left) and Andres Iniesta parade the European Cup after the 2009 win over Manchester United. Barcelona 4 Arsenal 1 (2009-10 quarter-final, second leg) One of Messi's finest performances as the maestro scored four times to demolish Arsenal's Champions League hopes. . With the last-eight tie locked at 2-2 from the first leg, the Nou Camp was stunned when Nicklas Bendtner scored a precious away goal on 18 minutes. From then on, it was a one-man show. . Messi had equalised within three minutes and had Barcelona in control with another couple before the break, including a sumptuous lob. A fourth late on made it an emphatic win. Messi scored four times as Barcelona demolished Arsenal in a 2010 quarter-final . Real Madrid 0 Barcelona 2 (2010-11 Semi-final, first leg) This Clasico semi-final in 2011 was a dream come true for all football fans and it was Messi and Barcelona that kept their cool as tempers frayed. . Real hothead Pepe was sent off in the 61st minute and boss Jose Mourinho sent to the Bernabeu stands shortly afterwards for protesting. Cue Messi to seize control, turning home Ibrahim Afellay's cross and then setting off on a 30-yard run to score the second. . Barcelona pile on Messi after his goal in the Bernabeu semi-final back in 2011. Barcelona 3 Manchester United 1 (2011 final at Wembley) Barcelona were unquestionably the best team in Europe at this time and another final triumph over United confirmed this. At Wembley, Pedro gave them the lead in the 27th minute, only for Wayne Rooney to level shortly afterwards. But Barca were by far the better team, dominating possession, and it came as little surprise when Messi fired home at the start of the second half. David Villa made sure 20 minutes from time as Barca claimed a third European Cup in five years. . Pep Guardiola is thrown into the air by Barcelona after their 2011 final win over Manchester United. Barcelona 7 Bayer Leverkusen 1 (2011-12 last 16, second leg) Messi raised his game to even greater heights, becoming the first player to score five goals in a Champions League fixture in this seven-goal drubbing of Bayer Leverkusen. . Leading 3-1 from the first leg in Germany, there was little pressure on Barca and their domination was exemplified by their 865 passes in the game to the German side's 217. . Many of them found their way to Messi, who scored twice before half-time and added another three after. Messi slots home his fourth goal in Barcelona's 7-1 demolition of Bayer Leverkusen in 2012. Manchester City 0 Barcelona 2 (2013-14 last 16, first leg) City desperately wanted to make a statement on the European stage but Barcelona had other ideas in this clinical away performance. . The decisive moment came in the 54th minute when Messi was fouled by Martin Demichelis, who was sent off. Messi dusted himself down to convert the penalty and Dani Alves delivered a late second after swapping passes with Neymar. Messi converts from the penalty spot in Barcelona's 2-0 win at Manchester City last season. 22 goals - AC Milan. 18 - Celtic, Chelsea. 17 - Manchester United, Bayer Leverkusen, Arsenal. 16 - Panathinaikos, Lyon. 14 - Galatasaray. 13 - Shakhtar Donetsk, Spartak Moscow, Paris Saint-Germain. 10 - Ajax, Stutgart. 9 - Porto, BATE Borisov. 8 - Sporting Lisbon, Werder Bremen, Newcastle United . 75 - Lionel Messi. 22 - Rivaldo. 20 - Patrick Kluivert. 19 - Luis Enrique. 16 - Samuel Eto'o. 15 - Pedro. 14 - Ronaldinho. 11 - Javier Saviola, Xavi. 10 - Andres Iniesta. 8 - Neymar, Thierry Henry, Hristo Stoichkov, David Villa. 7 - Luis Figo, Gerard Pique, own goals.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .",

        "doc": "According to an outside review by Columbia Journalism School professors, \"(a)n institutional failure at Rolling Stone resulted in a deeply flawed article about a purported gang rape at the University of Virginia.\" The Columbia team concluded that \"The failure encompassed reporting, editing, editorial supervision and fact-checking.\" Hardly a ringing endorsement of the editorial process at the publication. The magazine's managing editor, Will Dana, wrote, \"We would like to apologize to our readers and to all of those who were damaged by our story and the ensuing fallout, including members of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and UVA administrators and students.\" Brian Stelter: Fraternity to 'pursue all available legal action' The next question is:. Can UVA, Phi Kappa Psi or any of the other fraternities on campus sue for defamation? The Virginia Supreme Court said in Jordan v. Kollman that \"the elements of libel are (1) publication of (2) an actionable statement with (3) the requisite intent.\" \"Actionable\" means the statement must be both false and defamatory. Of course, the law of defamation must be balanced against the freedom of speech protected under not only the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, but also the Virginia Constitution. True statements cannot be defamatory. Neither can pure statements of opinion, because they theoretically cannot be either true or false. But the Rolling Stone article certainly purported to be fact, and it apparently is not exactly what the law considers \"true.\" The individual members of the fraternity will likely be considered private individuals, and not public figures; the latter have a harder time proving defamation. A private person suing for defamation must establish that the defendant has published a false factual statement that is about the person and that it also harms the person's reputation. The private plaintiff also must show that the defendant knew that the statement was false, or believed it was true but lacked a reasonable basis, or acted negligently in checking the facts. At first blush, that sounds like it fits perfectly, right? The Columbia report may go a long way toward establishing at least a modicum of the required intent. But that's only half the battle. There are strict rules about who can be a plaintiff in a defamation action like this. The identity of the aspiring plaintiff matters. First, let's eliminate UVA. The university is a public university, and therefore it is a governmental entity. The Supreme Court has been clear on the issue of libelous statements about the government: The government cannot sue for defamation. There is no such cause of action in American jurisprudence. Now the fraternities, starting with Phi Kappa Psi. A fraternity is not an individual, but a group. A plaintiff in a defamation case must show that the statements were \"of or concerning\" the plaintiff. It sounds obvious, but if you're going to say a statement hurt you, you have to prove the statement actually was about you to begin with. When the statements are about a group without naming an individual, it's hard to say the statement is \"concerning\" the individual -- and groups generally cannot sue.  For example, you can be sued if you call a specific lawyer a thief, but that same person cannot sue you if you simply call all lawyers thieves. Defamatory statements about a group are therefore not actionable by the group's individual members, for the most part. Like all rules, however, there are exceptions. If the defamatory language is about \"a comparatively small group of persons and the defamatory part is easily imputed against all members of the small group, an individual member may sue.\" If I said, \"The 1980 Philadelphia Phillies infielders were a bunch of criminals\" (they weren't),  the individual players could sue, because that mean statement is clearly about certain persons -- if I said that -- which I didn't. Phi Kappa Psi would likely argue that the \"small group\" exception fits it perfectly: Even if the individual members were not identified by name, the defamatory story has been imputed directly to individual members, who have suffered by their association with the group. On the other hand, Rolling Stone's lawyers would likely argue that the group is so large and fluid (after all, the membership changes somewhat every year), that even though the fraternity's reputation is tarnished, the members have suffered no individualized injury. As for the other fraternities on campus but not implicated in the story, that's likely a group that moves from the small category to large, and the members of Greek life generally will have a harder time bringing a lawsuit. Lawyers will tell you that a libel suit is one of those things that citizens often threaten each other with on Facebook, but that such cases are rarely actually filed. That's because a plaintiff usually has to show some kind of financial harm. So if your Aunt Edna calls you a loser on Twitter, you're going to have to spend money on an expert to explain to a jury how that actually damaged you financially. And since most of the people who waste time threatening each other with defamation suits  on Facebook live in their moms' basements and are \"between jobs,\" these are not the kind of people who have money or reputation to damage in the first place. The UVA situation is not your run-of-the-mill defamation case. The university won't be able to sue, but if the members of the fraternity can get past some of the preliminary hurdles of a defamation claim, and they can make a tangible case for damages, then this could be one of those rare successful defamation cases.",

In the wake of Hillary Clinton's presidential announcement, the \"holiday\" has special meaning. Clinton's election will no doubt center on women voters, and the Democratic women's agenda centers on pay equity and fairness in the workplace. Here's the thing: That 77-cent wage gap statistic is grossly overstated. It's a comparison of averages -- comparing full-time working women with full-time working men -- that doesn't control for any of the important factors that go into determining one's salary such as education, profession, title, time spent in the workforce and time spent in the office each day, to name a few. When we do control for these variables, a much smaller wage gap persists of about 4-6 cents, some of which may be the result of gender discrimination, but also is likely a function of women's choices and different behavior, such as not negotiating as often as men do -- factors for which economists simply can't control. The new women warriors: Reviving the fight for equal rights. I frequently reference my own experience as a working mom with young children as an example of someone who not only made the \"mistake\" of majoring in history but then pursued a career in the nonprofit political world -- not exactly a winning combination if a high salary is the ultimate goal. Add to this the fact that I took time out of the workplace and worked part time to have a family, and my earning potential simply isn't as high as some of my male counterparts. Opinion: Why Hillary Clinton should take a pay cut. Still, conservatives -- and by extension Republicans -- ought to be paying attention to Equal Pay Day. Because for many on the right the midterm election victories signaled that the \"war on women\" narrative was over. That Democrats had overplayed their hand and that candidates such as Colorado's Mark Udall simply couldn't succeed. In some respects, Republicans are right. Voters did choose policy substance over gendered rhetoric, and in many ways they rejected the insidious \"war on women\" narrative. The facts about the gender wage gap. But women voters are valuable, and Equal Pay Day ought to be a reminder that Democrats aren't ready to surrender. Let's remember a 5-point national gender gap still remains in the Democrats' favor. Bottom line: The \"war on women\" narrative hasn't been turned off -- it's simply shifted gears. And with the presidential election season just revving up, we can expect to see the \"war on women\" focus turn to the workplace, where Democrats will claim women are paid unfairly, not given the paid leave benefits they deserve and not given the child care support they demand. Many on the right fear if they try to push back on the issue of pay equity they will be skewered in the polls. But nothing could be further from the truth. Map: Where the gender pay gap is the widest. The Independent Women's Forum conducted a randomized, controlled experiment on the issue of the wage gap, and we found that not surprisingly the progressive message in favor of the Paycheck Fairness Act -- a legislative \"solution\" to close the pay gap -- increased support for the bill but surprisingly was not effective at increasing support for Democrats. In short, if the right is silent on the issue, the left has the potential to win the battle but not the war. It's tempting on days such as Equal Pay Day for Republicans to want to lie low -- to ignore the rhetoric and hope it will all go away by Wednesday. But the reality is that's the worst thing conservatives can do. The public is open to hearing the real story on pay equity, and conservatives need to be ready and willing to respond.",

        "doc": "On Thursday, NPR -- headquartered in Washington, just 40 miles away from Baltimore -- ran its latest update on the urban turmoil that has erupted in the wake of the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray because of still-unexplained spinal injuries that occurred while he was under police custody. Unfortunately, while it was a freshly produced segment, it was hardly a new story. Titled \"Baltimore Unrest Reveals Tensions Between African-Americans And Asians,\" the five-minute piece is urgently introduced with the promise that it will reveal \"what's really happening in the more troubled neighborhoods of this majority black city,\" going on state that a key ingredient of the unrest was African-Americans \"targeting Asian-owned businesses for destruction.\" A similar claim was made after Ferguson's uprising in August of last year. Indeed, it has been a toxic feature of the coverage of many episodes of mass metropolitan violence since the late 1980s, the era during which the trope of widespread hostility between Asian and black communities first took root in the media consciousness. Yes, interethnic tensions continue to exist, though they are hardly limited to Asians and blacks. And yes, this has resulted in troubling incidents and tragedies on both sides. But while reports say that during the chaotic social breakdowns of the past year, black-owned businesses were mostly protected during bouts of violence, there's little evidence to suggest a pattern in which Asian businesses have been actively targeted out of racial animus. Instead, it seems as if Asian-owned stores have experienced damage partly because they make up a portion of establishments operating in the most economically vulnerable and socially volatile of neighborhoods. In other words, they were collateral damage, along with other stores in the vicinity of riots. So it's time to call this persistent meme what it is: A misleading, hyperbolic and dangerous distraction, one that shifts blame away from the real issues. As Jennifer Lee, sociology professor at University of California, Irvine, and author of the 2002 book \"Civility in the City: Blacks, Jews and Koreans in Urban America,\" notes, \"the mainstream media continues to pit minority groups against one another to draw attention from larger structural problems that plague poor, disadvantaged communities. By directing our attention to interminority conflict, it directs blame away from the structures that perpetuate gross inequality and toward individual problems.\" Let's be honest. There were then -- and still are -- legitimate issues that exist between immigrant storeowners and the largely African American customers they serve that are rooted in extensive cultural differences. There's no denying that friction exists in the daily transaction between embattled communities trying hard to coexist under economic and social pressures. For example, in 1993, the robbery and shooting of Joel Lee, a 21-year-old Korean American at Towson State University, and the subsequent acquittal of his killer, was a point of contention between the Korean and African American communities. But things are different now. Decades after the height of media-inflamed tension between Asian and African Americans, patterns of immigration have shifted. Stores once operated by recent Korean immigrants are now owned by strivers from South Asia, the Middle East and Africa. The population of Baltimore has shrunk and its economy has contracted. Among merchants, there's ever-greater recognition that they and their customers are tied by a red thread, surviving or failing together. For decades, black and Asian advocacy groups have been trying to bridge differences between the communities. For example, the Baltimore-based Korean-American Grocers & Licensed Beverage Association of Maryland, founded in 1995, has worked to support its entrepreneurial members in their own attempts to address longstanding issues of neglect and abuse by Baltimore's police, while also encouraging them to build deeper ties with their constituents. A KAGRO-sponsored annual scholarship program has given hundreds of thousands of dollars in college grants to children growing up in the Baltimore neighborhoods their member retailers serve. These aren't the kind of stories you'll hear in the media. It's easier to focus on attention-grabbing anecdotes rather than the long, hard work of adjustment and accommodation going on within and around communities. Back in 1995, the Baltimore Sun profiled Soon Jae and Eun Ja Lee, owners of Lee's Food Market in the West Baltimore's Sandtown neighborhood -- the same part of the city that NPR called out as a locus of Asian-black tension. The story highlighted the Lees' openness to the community, their politeness and care for their customers and their outstanding generosity, which includes both free snacks to schoolchildren and the distribution of tens of thousands of free food baskets to needy local families each year. I spoke with Eun Ja Lee, calling her without warning to check on the status of the Lees' four-decade-old business after the violence of Monday and Tuesday. Were they open? Were they safe? \"Oh, of course we're open, we're always open!\" said Mrs. Lee, warmly and brightly. \"This week, many customers came in and said to me 'Mrs. Lee, don't worry you are part of our community, you are our family. We will make sure you are OK -- just stay open!' We love it. We love it.\" And yet, no one has come and interviewed her at their untouched and fully operational family market, nor have they talked with her customers, stoutly loyal after 37 years of patronage. Reinforcing the tired narrative of black-Asian interracial tension generates heat, but not light. There's a far more complex and nuanced relationship between these two urban populations, one that is in an ongoing state of evolution -- and it deserves to be told, not buried under cliches and clickbait.",

        "doc": "There can be no doubt that the bone-jarring collisions we see on Saturday will be far more substantial than the flick from David Beckham's right boot which led to Diego Simeone collapsing in apparent agony on the same pitch 17 years ago. This mouth-watering repeat of last year's European Cup semi-final in Saint-Etienne's famous Stade Geoffrey-Guichard will be no place for faint-hearted souls like Argentina's 1998 football World Cup captain. Instead, Saracens head coach Mark McCall wants warriors. Twenty-three of them, to be exact, if every player in his squad gets on to the field to face a Clermont Auvergne team that made Aviva Premiership champions Northampton look like a pub side only two weeks ago. Veteran fly half Charlie Hodgson will run the show for Saracens against Clermont on Saturday . England centre Brad Barritt will captain Mark McCall's side against at Stade Geoffroy-Guichard. Owen Farrell has recovered from a knee injury and has been named on the bench for the big clash . CLERMONT AUVERGNE: N Abendanon; N Nakaitaci, J Davies, W Fofana, N Nalaga; B James, L Radosavljevic; V Debaty, B Kayser, D Zirakashvili, J Cudmore, S Vahaamahina, J Bonnaire, D Chouly (capt), J Bardy. SARACENS: A Goode; C Ashton, M Bosch, B Barritt (capt), C Wyles; C Hodgson, R Wigglesworth; M Vunipola, J George, P Du Plessis, G Kruis, J Hamilton, M Itoje, B Vunipola, J Burger. Kick-off: 3.15pm, Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, Saint-Etienne. . TV: LIVE on BT Sport 1 from 2.30pm. Referee: George Clancy (Ireland). Jacques Burger, Clermont's nemesis in last year's semi-final, is back after a one-match ban while 20-year-old Maro Itoje will take the other flank in a Saracens pack that must match Clermont's monstrous eight for physicality. 'Experience tells us that in games as big and as difficult as this you need your warriors,' McCall said this week. Saracens' experience also tells them Clermont can be beaten. This time last year the sides met at the same stage and produced what many believed to be a seminal performance in Sarries' history as Vern Cotter's men were crushed 46-6 at Twickenham. There were warriors aplenty for the men in black that day as Saracens powered into their first European Cup final only to fall short against a Jonny Wilkinson-inspired Toulon in the final. Maro Itoje has been named to start at blindside flanker following a string of impressive performances . On Saturday, a similarly Herculean effort will be required against a Clermont side who have almost forgotten how to lose at their own Stade Marcel-Michelin. Stade Geoffrey-Guichard, however, is not home territory for either club, though Saracens travel as underdogs. 'Playing away from home has always galvanised us,' said Saracens battle-hardened centre Brad Barritt — captain in the absence of Alistair Hargreaves. 'Early in this team's evolution we spoke about going to these arenas where Saracens had never won and knocking over another hurdle. This is another chance to make an everlasting memory and take a massive scalp. It's something that brings the best out of this team.' Clermont have an array of attacking talent that can hurt Saracens with Wesley Fofana to the fore . Few teams know each other better, with last year's semi-final still fresh in the memory as well as two pool games this season which saw honours shared. This week McCall invited Jim McGuinness, the former Donegal gaelic football manager and current Celtic psychologist, to address the squad before training. McCall said: 'When Jim took over in 2010 Donegal hadn't won a game for three seasons and hadn't won a championship in 19.

        "doc": "Divock Origi has revealed that the progress of Jordon Ibe at Liverpool this season has left him counting the days until he makes his Anfield bow. The Belgium striker was signed by Liverpool in a £10million deal after impressing at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, before being loaned back to Lille for the 2014-15 season. But Origi has been following Liverpool's progress from across the English Channel and after seeing the rise of Ibe and Raheem Sterling, is eagerly anticipating working under Brendan Rodgers. Divock Origi said the progress of Liverpool's youngsters have heightened his excitement at joining the club . Origi referenced the progress of winger Jordon Ibe (left) as an example of youth players improving at the club. Origi added that he thinks the long-term progress of Raheem Sterling means he is joining the right club. 'When you see how the coach and the staff work with the young players - how Sterling, for example, has learned over the years and how Ibe is now integrating with the team, it is very interesting,' Origi told Liverpool's official website. 'It is very nice to have seen that this season. 'The manager is one of the reasons I came to Liverpool - he's someone who has proven he knows how to work with young players, knows how to develop young players and also lets them play.' Origi, who has scored seven times in Ligue 1 this season, believes that the backing of Liverpool's supporters will help him elevate his game. 'I'm somebody who when I feel loved, when I feel appreciated by the supporters, then I can give even more. It gives you a boost on the field. In Belgium it was this way, and I can see it at Liverpool.' Origi (second eight) earned a transfer to Liverpool after impressing for Belgium at the 2014 World Cup. Origi added that the challenges he has faced at Lille this season will make him a better player for Liverpool. Origi admits it has been a challenging season at Lille attempting balance the demands of the league with the Europa League but believes the experience he has gained means he will arrive at Liverpool a better player than this time last year. 'In a mental aspect, I've learnt a lot and I've learnt a lot about football and people looking at you,' Origi said. 'It's made me stronger and that's essential for me before coming to Liverpool.'",

        "doc": "According to an outside review by Columbia Journalism School professors, \"(a)n institutional failure at Rolling Stone resulted in a deeply flawed article about a purported gang rape at the University of Virginia.\" The Columbia team concluded that \"The failure encompassed reporting, editing, editorial supervision and fact-checking.\" Hardly a ringing endorsement of the editorial process at the publication. The magazine's managing editor, Will Dana, wrote, \"We would like to apologize to our readers and to all of those who were damaged by our story and the ensuing fallout, including members of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and UVA administrators and students.\" Brian Stelter: Fraternity to 'pursue all available legal action' The next question is:. Can UVA, Phi Kappa Psi or any of the other fraternities on campus sue for defamation? The Virginia Supreme Court said in Jordan v. Kollman that \"the elements of libel are (1) publication of (2) an actionable statement with (3) the requisite intent.\" \"Actionable\" means the statement must be both false and defamatory. Of course, the law of defamation must be balanced against the freedom of speech protected under not only the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, but also the Virginia Constitution. True statements cannot be defamatory. Neither can pure statements of opinion, because they theoretically cannot be either true or false. But the Rolling Stone article certainly purported to be fact, and it apparently is not exactly what the law considers \"true.\" The individual members of the fraternity will likely be considered private individuals, and not public figures; the latter have a harder time proving defamation. A private person suing for defamation must establish that the defendant has published a false factual statement that is about the person and that it also harms the person's reputation. The private plaintiff also must show that the defendant knew that the statement was false, or believed it was true but lacked a reasonable basis, or acted negligently in checking the facts. At first blush, that sounds like it fits perfectly, right? The Columbia report may go a long way toward establishing at least a modicum of the required intent. But that's only half the battle. There are strict rules about who can be a plaintiff in a defamation action like this. The identity of the aspiring plaintiff matters. First, let's eliminate UVA. The university is a public university, and therefore it is a governmental entity. The Supreme Court has been clear on the issue of libelous statements about the government: The government cannot sue for defamation. There is no such cause of action in American jurisprudence. Now the fraternities, starting with Phi Kappa Psi. A fraternity is not an individual, but a group. A plaintiff in a defamation case must show that the statements were \"of or concerning\" the plaintiff. It sounds obvious, but if you're going to say a statement hurt you, you have to prove the statement actually was about you to begin with. When the statements are about a group without naming an individual, it's hard to say the statement is \"concerning\" the individual -- and groups generally cannot sue.  For example, you can be sued if you call a specific lawyer a thief, but that same person cannot sue you if you simply call all lawyers thieves. Defamatory statements about a group are therefore not actionable by the group's individual members, for the most part. Like all rules, however, there are exceptions. If the defamatory language is about \"a comparatively small group of persons and the defamatory part is easily imputed against all members of the small group, an individual member may sue.\" If I said, \"The 1980 Philadelphia Phillies infielders were a bunch of criminals\" (they weren't),  the individual players could sue, because that mean statement is clearly about certain persons -- if I said that -- which I didn't. Phi Kappa Psi would likely argue that the \"small group\" exception fits it perfectly: Even if the individual members were not identified by name, the defamatory story has been imputed directly to individual members, who have suffered by their association with the group. On the other hand, Rolling Stone's lawyers would likely argue that the group is so large and fluid (after all, the membership changes somewhat every year), that even though the fraternity's reputation is tarnished, the members have suffered no individualized injury. As for the other fraternities on campus but not implicated in the story, that's likely a group that moves from the small category to large, and the members of Greek life generally will have a harder time bringing a lawsuit. Lawyers will tell you that a libel suit is one of those things that citizens often threaten each other with on Facebook, but that such cases are rarely actually filed. That's because a plaintiff usually has to show some kind of financial harm. So if your Aunt Edna calls you a loser on Twitter, you're going to have to spend money on an expert to explain to a jury how that actually damaged you financially. And since most of the people who waste time threatening each other with defamation suits  on Facebook live in their moms' basements and are \"between jobs,\" these are not the kind of people who have money or reputation to damage in the first place. The UVA situation is not your run-of-the-mill defamation case. The university won't be able to sue, but if the members of the fraternity can get past some of the preliminary hurdles of a defamation claim, and they can make a tangible case for damages, then this could be one of those rare successful defamation cases.",
